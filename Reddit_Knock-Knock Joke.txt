Knock knock Why does r/Jokes feel like r/gatekeeping?  This should be a place for people with a sense of humour, if you don't like the joke don't upvote.  The simple jokes here and in the comments (where the best jokes often are) brighten my day and lighten the load of life.  There are not going to be many 100% original ideas that are relatable, evolution takes tiny steps, so a small change in any joke is the first step in taking comedy somewhere new and different.  TL/DR: Let people laugh.
