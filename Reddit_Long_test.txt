[Long] Two robots were fighting each other Two robots were in a wrestling match, where the stakes were extremely high. Both parties tore savagely at each other, round after round, as they attempted to get the upper hand.  In the first round, the first robot had the lead, when he was able to tear out a crucial wire in the other robot's body. The other robot, not to be defeated, was also successful in doing the same to the first robot. The first round was not won by any robot.  The second round was more interesting, where the second robot was able to remove a large amount of the covering that the first robot had. Both robots were covered in protective material (so they weren't killed instantly), so the loss of the material was a huge blow to the first robot.  In the third round, both sides, having taken a break (and some steroids perhaps) tore at each other more savagely than before, managing to remove all the protective material that shielded each robot. The match, being extremely close, was finally ended when the first robot succeeded in knocking down the second robot.  The audience could only say this: The battle came down to the wire.  *kthxbai*
A Kung Fu student asks his teacher "Master, why does my ability not improve? I'm always defeated."   And the master, pensive and forever patient, answers: "My dear pupil, have you seen the gulls flying by the setting sun, and their wings seeming like flames?" "Yes, my master, I have."   "And a waterfall, spilling mightly over the stones without taking anything out of its proper place?" "Yes, my master, I have witnessed it."   "And the moon... when it touches the calm water to reflect all its enormous beauty?" "Yes, my master, I have also seen this marvelous phenomenon."   "That is the problem. You keep watching all this shit instead of training."
A Priest, A Minister, A Rabbi And A Bear A priest, a minister, and a rabbi want to see who’s best at his job. So each one goes into the woods, finds  a bear, and attempts to convert it. Later, they all get together. The priest begins: “When I found the bear, I read to him from the catechism and sprinkled him with holy water. Next week is his first Communion.”  “I found a bear by the stream,” says the minister, “and preached God’s holy Word. The bear was so mesmerized that he let me baptize him.”  They both look down at the rabbi, who is lying on a gurney in a body cast. “Looking back,” he says, “maybe I shouldn’t have started with the  circumcision.” 
Boss is boss. A highly successful Boss  was going home in his car when he saw two men along the roadside eating grass. Disturbed by the sight, he ordered his driver to stop and  got out to investigate.   He asked one man  "Why are you eating grass?"  "We don't have any money for food," the poor man replied. "We have to eat grass."   "Well, then, you can come with me to my house and I'll feed you" the boss  said.  "But sir, I have a wife and five children with me. They are over there, under that tree".  "Bring them along," the boss  replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, "You come with us also."  The second man, in a pitiful voice then said, "But sir, I also have a wife and seven children with me!"  "Bring them all, as well," the boss answered.  They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as it was.   One of the poor fellows turned to the boss  and said, "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."  The boss replied, "Glad to do it. You'll really love my place; the grass is almost 1 meter high!"   _*Lesson :* Never trust  Bosses... They will go to any extreme to finish their job._   *And there is none like a KIND BOSS 
The Shaggy Dog (My Favorite Joke, As I Tell It) A man goes to adopt a dog. He's shown an old dog no one wants to adopt because he's too shaggy. The man feels bad for the dog, and decides to take him home. His wife is startled - "Why, that's the shaggiest dog I've ever seen in my life! Look at that dog! Unbelievable!"  The man finds out that the county fair has a competition for shaggiest dog. The owner of the shaggiest dog gets $100! The man takes his shaggy dog to the fair and the judges unanimously declare him the winner.  After the competition, one of the judges tracks the man down before he can leave.   "I used to judge these things at the highest level, you know," says the judge. "I retired years ago, settled down, had some kids. I just do this county fair competition for fun, it reminds me of the good times. But when I saw your dog I just knew I had to come find you. I've seen the shaggiest dogs God ever put on this earth.   I remember the world champion shaggy dog Bessie, in 1989, why, I couldn't believe how shaggy that dog was. Owned by a man named John Tackle. She gave his life meaning. Passed away a couple years ago, very sad. I thought Bessie was the shaggiest dog I would ever see. That's when I knew it was time to retire. I couldn't make up a dog that shaggy. But your dog, sir? I can't believe it. Your dog is the shaggiest dog I have ever seen in all my long life. You can't waste this opportunity.  These shaggy dog competitions, they're very elite. The state competition is next week. I know the woman who oversees it and I can get your dog in. Please don't waste this opportunity, sir. Your dog could be a champion, the shaggiest dog in the world."  The man listens to the judge, and enters his dog in the state shaggy dog competition. Again, they win unanimously. This time the prize is $10,000. The man can't believe his luck.  Now he's a local celebrity. The media camps out on his front lawn at all hours of the day, his phone is ringing off the hook 24/7, all his friends and family are telling people about how they know the man and his shaggy dog.  The man and his dog enter the national shaggy dog competition. 60 Minutes does a segment on him and his shaggy dog preparing for the gruelling competition.  The man confidently walks his dog out in front of the judges and they fall silent. One judge breaks down in tears, stunned by the shagginess of the man's shaggy dog. The man is awarded top prize, $100,000.  The man's moment has come. There is only one more mountain to climb - the world championship for shaggy dogs. It is a brutal competition. Doping scandals, bomb threats, shaggy dog groomers committing suicide. This is as cutthroat as it gets - by comparison, the Olympics look like a Little League game.  Top prize is 10 million dollars. The man and his wife quit their jobs to enter the shaggy dog competition circuit. They risked everything they had, and the prize money is running out. This is it - the big kahuna. With the 10 million dollars they could finally realize their dream of retiring to a nice cottage in the Scottish countryside. No more work, no more stress or worries. Just the two of them, and that shaggy dog living out the rest of their lives in comfort and bliss.  The man brings his dog out in front of the judges. The head judge leans forward and says:  "Why, that's not a shaggy dog! That's a cat!"
Heroic last words There was a guy looking at his basement. He had a wide open space that he thought, "I could fill this space with an amazing painting." He thought about what was most important to him, and hired a painter.   When the painter came in to look at the space the man said, "I really admire Custer from the battle of Little Big Horn. I feel he's a very honorable man. I want his last thought painted on my wall, because they have to be the most inspiring words."  The painter looked at the man and said, "give me two weeks, and I'll paint his last thoughts on your wall."  Two weeks go by and the man is excited. He's looking forward to being inspired everyday. The painter says, "I think you're going to be really excited by what you see here." When the man looks upon the mural  all he sees is Jesus on the Cross and Native Americans fornicating in a field.   "What the hell is this?" The man asks.  The painter replies, "We obviously Custer's last thoughts were 'Jesus Christ where did all these fucking Indians come from?!'"
Little Johnny is given the task of coming up with a true anecdote with a moral. Luckily for Johnny, he has a family reunion on the weekend, so he knows there will be plenty to choose from.   On Monday, the teacher asked Little Teresa, "What's your story?"   Little Teresa replied, "Well, Poppa owns a chicken farm, and once we were taking eggs to the market to sell. But, when driving to the market, we hit a bump and half of the eggs broke!"   "What's the moral of that story, Little Teresa?" the teacher asked.   "Don't put all of your eggs in one basket." She proclaimed proudly.   The teacher then asked Little Timmy for his story. "Well, we also have a chicken farm, and on the weekend we had a dozen eggs ready to hatch. But, only half of them hatched!"   "What's the moral of that story?" the teacher asked.   "Don't count your chickens before the hatch." said Timmy.   "And what's your story, Johnny?"  "Well, Uncle Joe fought in the Vietnam War, and he was in a plane when the Vietnamese shot it down! So he grabbed a parachute, a gun, a machete, and a six pack of beer before jumping out of the plane. He opened his parachute and drank all of the beer on his way down. But, he landed in the middle of 200 Vietnamese soldiers! So, he took his gun and shot 100 of them down, like BANG BANG BANG! But then he ran out of ammo, so he took his machete and chopped 80 to pieces like CHOP CHOP CHOP! But them, the machete broke, so he killed the last 20 soldiers with his bare hands!"   The teacher was aghast. "What moral could you possibly draw from that story?"   Johnny declared, "Don't fuck with Uncle Joe when he's been drinking!" 
A building contracter hires an Englishman, an Irishman, and a Chinaman. He gathers them all in his office and tells each of them their jobs. The Englishman to shovel a pile of sand. The Irishman has to take the sand in the wheelbarrow to the truck. The Chinaman is in charge of supplies. The boss comes back two hours later and he sees the Englishman and the Irishman having a cup of tea. ''So have you done the work then?'' he asks. The workers both shake their heads and tell him that the Chinaman didn't give them a shovel or a wheelbarrow. The boss is infuriated by this and asks the workers if they have seen the Chinaman, they tell him they thought they saw him going toward the truck. So the boss sets out towards the truck and just as he is getting close to the truck the Chinaman jumps out from behind a wall and yells, "SUPPLIES!"
Fair Justice A man was brought before the judge and charged with NECROPHILIA.. (having sex with a dead person).   The judge told him, "In 20 years on the bench, I've never heard such a disgusting, immoral thing.   Just give me one good reason why I shouldn't lock you up and throw away the jail keys in the toilet?"   The man replied, "I'll give you THREE good reasons:   1. It's none of your damn business;  2. She was my wife; and...  3. I didn't KNOW she was dead, she ALWAYS acted that way!"  The case was dismissed and the judge announced the following warnings:  For the ladies::  PLEASE TRY TO MOVE A LITTLE DURING THE ACT.  For the guys: IF THERE IS NOT MUCH MOVEMENT, STOP IMMEDIATELY AND CHECK IF SHE IS ALIVE ....!!!   Case dismissed!
(Long) Old anecdote about an American on a train. An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat.  The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. The war weary soldier asked, “Please, ma’am, may I sit in that seat?”  The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, “You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can’t you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?”  The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.  Again he asked, “Please, lady. May I sit there? I’m very tired.”  The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, “You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!”  The soldier didn’t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.  The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.  An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, “You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road.  “And now, Sir, you’ve thrown the wrong bitch out the window.”

A Calvinist arrived at the Gates of Heaven. He sees that there are two lines going in. One has a sign that reads "predestined," and the other, "free will". He naturally heads to the predestined line.  While waiting, an angel comes and asks him "Why are you in this line?"  He replies, "Because I chose it."  The angel looks surprised, "Well, if you 'chose' it, then you should be in the free will line."  So our Calvinist, now slightly miffed, obediently wanders over to the free will line.  Again, after a few minutes, another angel asks him, "Why are you in this line?"  He sullenly replies, "Someone made me come here."
John is caught in a fire and burnt to death. His two close friends, Sean and Jack, are called in to identify his body.  The mortician calls Sean in. Sean looks at the body and says, "Yep, he's burnt pretty bad. Roll him over." The mortician rolls him over. Sean takes one look and says, "Nah, it's not John."  The mortician is confused and sends for Jack. Jack sees the body and says, "Damn, he's badly burnt. Roll him over." The mortician rolls him over. Jack looks at the body and declares, "Nope, this isn't John."  The mortician asks, "How can you tell?"  Jack says, "Well, John had two assholes."   "What? Two assholes?" The mortician asks, confused.   "Yep, everyone knew that. Every time we went into town, people would say, 'here comes John with the two assholes'."
There once was a young engineer... There once was a young engineer, who after having worked for several years, decided that he and his family should have a weekend getaway place. He searched the surrounding country and found a lovely spot with frontage on a small river. He and his family built a cabin and began spending time there every chance they got. The kids loved it. Friends visited for the quiet and the fishing.  The engineer however, wanted something unique for his cabin. He had been an award-winning pole vaulter in college. He therefore built a set of poles with a crosspiece, and a mulched run. He bought a new carbon fiber vaulting pole and a new pair of shoes, and was all set.  He would set off down the run, plant his pole, soar over the crosspiece, and land in the river with a satisfying splash. It was a great way to spend a hot afternoon.  The engineer and his family had been enjoying the cabin for years, and went out early in the spring. It had been a very wet winter, with lots of rain afterwards. When they arrived, the river was up and flowing at a good clip, with twice the usual amount of current flowing.  The engineer was determined to enjoy a few vaults into the water, even though his wife thought it was too dangerous. He was a good swimmer however, and proceeded to have a go at it. His run and jump were flawless. He hit the water in good form, but he was swept downstream and disappeared. His body was found later that day, tangled in debris on the side of the stream.  It was a sad end for the engineer. His family sold the cabin, with no desire to return to the scene of such tragedy.  Our lamented engineer was a civil engineer. Had he consulted an electrical engineer, he would have been warned that it's not the vaultage that kills you, it's the current.

A $200 vagina? Two couples were playing poker one evening.  Jim accidentally dropped some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed Bob's wife, Sue wasn't wearing any underwear under her dress! Shocked by this, Jim upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table and emerged red-faced.  Later, Jim went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bob's wife followed and asked, 'Did you see anything that you like under there?' Surprised by her boldness, Jim admitted that, well indeed he did.  She said, 'Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500. 'After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, Jim confirms that he is interested.  Sue told him that since her husband Bob worked Friday afternoons and Jim didn't, Jim should be at her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.  When Friday rolled around, Jim showed up at Bob's house at 2 p.m. sharp - and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500 - they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed.  Jim quickly dressed and left. As usual, Bob came home from work at 6 p.m. And upon arriving, asked his wife: 'Did Jim come by the house this afternoon?'  With a lump in her throat Sue answered 'Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon.'  Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, 'And did he give you $500?'  Sue, using her best poker face, replied, 'Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500.'  Bob, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, 'He came by the office this morning and borrowed $500 from me. He promised he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home and pay me back.'
Never tell the same joke twice Some time is my early childhood my father said,     everytime you tell a joke it loses value,     now I thought this was good advice so I     decided never to use anyone elses jokes ever.     Not once did I tell someone elses joke,     usually I didnt tell jokes at all because it was too     damn hard to come up with something original     eventually I gave up and started telling others jokes     so in conclusion, read the first letter of each line.    
Oh crap!! A local preacher was dissatisfied with the small amount in the collection plates each Sunday. Someone suggested to him that perhaps he might be able to hypnotize the congregation into giving more. "And just how would I go about doing that?" he asked.  "It is very simple. First you turn off the air conditioner so that the auditorium is warmer than usual. Then you preach in a monotone. Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a slow arc above the lectern and suggest they put 20 dollars in the collection plate."  So the very next Sunday, the reverend did as suggested, and lo and behold the plates were full of 20 dollar bills. Now, the preacher did not want to take advantage of this technique each and every Sunday. So therefore, he waited for a couple of weeks and then tried his mass hypnosis again.  Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerized, the chain on the watch broke and the watch hit the lectern with a loud thud and springs and parts flew everywhere.  "Crap!" exclaimed the pastor.  It took them a week to clean up the church

A young family moved into a house... next to a vacant lot. One day, a Construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.    The young family's 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.    Eventually the construction crew, all of them "gems-in-the-rough" more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.     The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars "pay" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.    When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age. The little girl proudly replied: "I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us."    "Oh my goodness gracious," said the teller, "and will you be working on the house again this week, too?"    The little girl replied, "I will, if those assholes from the lumber yard ever deliver the damn sheet rock."

In an alternate reality, Bill Gates was killed in 2003. When he was waiting in Purgatory, he was informed that in his life, he'd done enough good and bad that he could choose whether he wanted to spend eternity in Heaven or Hell. He asked that a delegate of both parties prepare a computer presentation to illustrate the advantages of each, and he would make a decision based on what he was shown. His only requirement was that each side be completely honest in its presentation. They had a full week to come up with their presentations.   When the time came to show their presentations, the delegates from Heaven and Hell brought their computers and set them one-at-a-time in front of Bill. The delegate from Heaven showed him pictures and videos of angels lazily floating around to homes made of clouds. It looked peaceful and beautiful, but slightly dull. Bill thought it looked pretty nice, but wanted to see what Hell had to offer before making a decision.  When the Hellish delegate set down the computer, it showed a stream of pictures and videos of beautiful people on beaches, drinking wine and other beverages, eating delicious meals, flaming desserts and enjoying each others' company. Other images showed people racing cars, playing golf and having a grand time.  Obviously, Bill was much more impressed with the presentation Hell put together and immediately declared they he would spend eternity in Hell. While Heaven was disappointed, they knew that there was no changing Bill's mind. That watched as Bill was led off to his new life in Hell.   A few weeks later, God decided to check up on Bill and see how he was enjoying his life down in Hell. What he found was a screaming Bill strung up on a rack and being tortured personally by Satan himself. When Bill saw God looking on, he screamed "WHAT DID I DO? I WAS SHOWN A PARADISE! THIS IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT I SAW!" Satan shared a significant look with God before saying "Oh that was just the screensaver."
[Long] A passenger plane is flying through the Himalayas A passenger plane is flying through the Himalayas. Suddenly, a giant mountain appears. It does not seem like that the plane is able to fly over the mountain.  The pilot says: "Dear passengers, please stay calm. Due to exceeding our weight limit, our plane is not flying at our desired altitude. So in order to gain more altitude and fly over this mountain, we have to discard all the luggage."  The passengers, though very unhappy about it, are more concerned about their safety. So after the luggage is discarded, the plane is able to fly over the mountain. Everybody claps.  However, another mountain appears, thus one even higher than the last one.   Pilot: "Dear passengers, we sadly have not reached our desired altitude yet. Thus, we have to throw out all your backpacks, laptops, and other loose objects in order to lose weight."  Same with last time, the passengers do as told, so the plane gains altitude and flies over the mountain. Everybody claps.  Finally, an unbelievably high mountain appears, easily topping the first two.  Pilot: "Dear passengers, I am sad to inform you that we do not have the necessary altitude to pass this mountain. Furthermore, we have discarded nearly everything. But fear not, this plane is able to detach its floor to lose even more weight! However, you have to hold on to the handrails on the ceiling until the end if the flight. I am sorry there is no other choice..."  The passengers do as told and grab on to the handrails while the floor is being detached. With that done, the plane passes the mountain.  Pilot: "We have now passed the last mountain. Thank you very much for your cooperation!"  Everybody claps.

Slow wife A village man decided to walk 5 miles to town for some supplies.  While there, he saw a bull for sale.  It was a grand bull and decided to buy it.  After making the purchase, he realized he would need his wife to come help him bring the bull back home.  At the time, the only way to communicate to anyone was via telegraph, however, he only had enough money to send one word.  He thought for a moment, and wrote down the word on a piece of paper and handed it to the operator.  The operator looked at the paper, then at the village man and said, "Comfortable".  "How is your wife going to know you need her to come with just this single word?"  The village man replied, "Don't worry, she's a very, very slow reader".
There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living... There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.  He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.   He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.   Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.   He made it out, but a single person died.   Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.   He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.   When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.   After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.   And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.   Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.   Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.   The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.   For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.   After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.   And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.   To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.   And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.   On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.  "You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.   The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.   The executioner was speechless.  The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."
A Pirate Captain and his First Mate are having a conversation They stand next to each other on the bow of the ship. The boy looks sad staring down into the ocean below. "What's the matter with ya lad?" Asked the Captain in his gruff aggressive voice.  "Black beard, sir, it's just that....I feel like I don't know nothing. Like I'm not as smart as everyone else." The boy says timidly.  "Well lad, you was born on this very vessel. You lived here your whole life. You shan't be expected to know nothin" Blackbeard says before spitting down into the ocean. "...Can I ask you questions then? About tings I wanna know?" He replies excitedly. "Aye." Blackbeard responds slowly. "What do you call those things, those things like us, they walk around and have long hair and high voices?" "A Lass, Me Matey" "..." "..." "Yes sir?" "that's it.."
Pearly Gates Duty It was time for St Peter's annual three-week vacation, and Jesus volunteered to fill in for him at the Pearly Gates.  "It's no big deal," St Peter explained. "Just sit at the registration desk, and ask each person a little about his or her life. Then, send them to housekeeping to pick up their wings."  On the third day, Jesus looked up to see a bewildered old man standing in front of him. He asked the old man to tell him something about himself. "I'm a simple carpenter," said the old man. "And once I had a son. He was born in a very special way, and was unlike anyone else in the world. He went through a great transformation even though he had holes in his hands and feet. He was taken from me a long time ago, but his spirit lives on forever. All over the world people tell his story."  By this time, Jesus was standing with his arms outstretched. There were tears in his eyes, as he embraced the old man. "Father," he cried. "It's been so long."  The old man squinted, removed his glasses, stares blankly for a moment while he wiped the glasses, returned the glasses to his head, looked at Jesus again and said, "Pinocchio?"
I was in the grocery store today and I can't believe what happened... I was in line and the guy ahead of me didn't smell like he stepped in crap he smelled like he rolled in it.

On his way to the exit, his stool rolled out of his pant leg and onto the floor.  The cashier stormed over to him "You said you didn't crap your pants!!" then he said "Oh I'm sorry.  I thought you meant today."
Apocalypse A zombie apocalypse had taken over the world, everywhere had become a wasteland and most of the world’s population had been annihilated. Carl, lone survivor from Wayland Kentucky, was venturing the land looking for somewhere to take shelter.  One day, starving and desperate, he encountered a prison. The place was full of survivors armed with swords, spears, axes and all kinds of hand held weaponry. The settlers took him in, fed him and made him feel human again.  That night, they heard loud groans start to surround the prison. Zombies had breached the prison gates and minutes later had besieged the prison. The settlers did all they could but their weapons just weren’t up to the task. Everyone was killed, all apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who escaped as the last few were eaten alive.   Stumbling through the night, with zombies closing in behind, Carl discovered a wrecked shopping mall. The settlers let him inside. They were armed to the teeth with an arsenal of firearms. Pistols, assault rifles, military grade weapons, the lot.  Carl hastily warned them that there was a pack of zombies in pursuit, but when they looked hundreds had gathered behind Carl and were now headed straight for the mall. The settlers fired every weapon they had at them, but the zombies bulldozed through the wall of bullets and all of the settlers in the shopping mall were massacred. All apart from our lone survivor, Carl, who eluded death once again.  He escaped into a dark wood behind the mall, stumbling over fallen foliage. With an army of zombies hunting him down, he ran into a huge wooden wall. As he got closer to the entrance, he saw a chicken dressed in military fatigues. The chicken scratched its feet on the floor, clucked three times and pecked on the huge wooden gates. They opened with an enormous “Creeeeek”. Inside was a farm, an old redneck farmer and his wife. “Hi there sonny”, said the farmer, “come on in ayn ava drink”  Swiftly, Carl warned them that there were hundreds of zombies chasing him, maybe even thousands by now, but they didn’t seem bothered at all.  “Shouldn’t we do something? Where are your weapons? Haven’t you even got any weapons at all” Carl bellowed.  “Naw, we won't need em”, said the farmer  “The chick’n will deal with em” said his wife, calmly.  Carl was anxious, but he was fed up of running and wanted to see what this chicken could do, so he watched in anticipation...   The Zombies approached, and one by one the chicken took them down. It pecked through their brains, scratched off their heads and kicked the living dead crap out of thousands of them.  Astounded, Carl said, “I’ve just seen that group of zombies tear through two settlements, both armed to the teeth with an incredible armoury of weapons, and your chicken has just taken all of them all out single handed, how? How did that just happen!?”  “Well”, said the farmer, “we figur’d it out a lon lon time ago. We dun' need any weapon’s at all, for the Hen is mightier than the Horde.”    I wrote and posted this joke a few weeks back, but made some improvements​ recently and wondered how the joke now fairs.  Hope you liked it and feedback is very welcome. I'd like to somehow make the punchline more fitting... Maybe Carl should be a lawyer or something? Any thoughts? Thanks guys

I really regret when I hit her She was sitting in front of me doing nothing wrong. her body was smooth, and she was wearing that pink heart sticker I gave her for her birthday. We were together for 5 years and some might say this is a long time to be together, some of my friends even said I needed a new one, but she was mine and I needed her just as much as she needed me.  In April 2016 she caught a virus, it caused her to act differently and she became very slow. I did everything I could to make her feel better.  I rubbed her,   I touched her,  I cleaned her but nothing helped.   I'm in tears typing this, but out of frustration I hit her with a sledge hammer. She slammed shut and exploded into a bunch of pieces. The love of my life is gone and I have no one to blame but myself.  R.I.P dell, April 2011-2016 
Three men arrive at a checkpoint near the gates of heaven The first man walks up to god, who is reading the summary of his deeds before deciding which vehicle he is to use to drive to heavens gates with.  "I see you were quite unfaithful with your wife, cheating on her a total of three times." The man looks down in shame. "You are to drive up to heaven in a battered sedan." God waved him away to a drab looking Honda as he called the next man forward.  "I see you never truly cheated on your wife, but you had many impure thoughts of other women and made several attempts at adultery." The man shrugged, a little nervous. "Only natural," God said, "You can drive up in the sports car." God then waved him away to a modest but sleek looking Dodge.  "Ah, you are clean as a whistle!" God said to the last man. "You never even thought of cheating on your wife, what loyalty! You can have your choice of either a Rolls Royce, Ferrari or Corvette!" The man, beaming, chose the Ferrari as it was his personal favorite car in life.  As the man cruised up to heaven in his Ferrari, he saw his wife to the right of him, struggling along in a rusty tricycle.

Retirement village One day, while going to the shop, I passed by a retirement village. On the front lawn were six old ladies, lying naked on the grass. I thought this was a bit unusual, but continued on my way. On my return trip, I passed the same retirement village with the same six old ladies lying naked on the lawn. This time my curiosity got the better of me and I went inside to talk to the retirement village Administrator, and asked her, "Do you know there are six ladies lying naked on your front lawn?" "Yes," she said, "aren't they darlings? They're retired prostitutes - they're having a yard sale.
A beech tree and a birch tree were best friends until... A seedling sprouted up between them. The trees began arguing over whose spawn the seedling was: "Son of a beech"  "Son of a birch"  "Son of a beech"  "Son of a birch"  Until a woodpecker flew over them and heard their argument. The woodpecker flew down and asked them why they were arguing.  "We don't know whose seedling this is!!!" The trees responded.  "Well I know quite a bit about trees and wood. Why don't I fly around the forest for a little bit and do some research?" The woodpecker offered. The trees agreed and he flew off.  A couple of days went by and the two trees continued arguing. Finally the woodpecker came back. As soon as he landed the trees asked impatiently "Well whose kid is that? Son of a birch or son of a beech?"  The woodpecker paused for a moment and said "I don't know about any of that but I do know it's the finest piece of ash I've ever stuck my pecker in"  
What Religion Is Your BRA? A man walked into the ladies department and shyly walked up to the woman behind the counter and said:  "I'd like to buy a bra for my wife."  "What type of bra?" asked the clerk.  "Type?" inquires the man, "There"s more than one type?"  "Look around," said the saleslady, as she showed a sea of bras in every shape, size, color and material imaginable."  "Actually, even with all of this variety, there are really only four types of bras to choose from."  Relieved, the man asked about the types.  The saleslady replied: "There are the Catholic, Salvation Army, Presbyterian, and the Baptist types. Which one would you prefer?"  Now totally befuddled, the man asked about the differences between them. The Saleslady responded, "It is all really quite simple."  The Catholic type supports the masses . . .  The Salvation Army type lifts the fallen . . .  The Presbyterian type keeps them staunch and upright . . .  The Baptist type makes mountains out of molehills . . .  Oh, and have you ever wondered why A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, G, and H are the letters used to define bra sizes? If you have wondered why, but couldn't figure out what the letters stood for, it is about time you became informed!  {A} Almost Boobs.  {B} Barely there.  {C} Can"t Complain.  {D} Dang!  {DD} Double dang!  {E} Enormous!  {F} Fake  {G} Get a Reduction  {H} Help me, I've fallen and I can"t get up!  Oh they forgot the German bra: Holtzemfromfloppen

An inspector goes to check on a factory that makes baby bottles and condoms. When he arrives he meets the supervisor who gives him the tour around the factory. He is first shown the bottle section and he doesn't notice anything out of place.  Afterwards, they walk to the condom and nipple (the rubber thing on top of bottles) section of the factory. The machines that makes condoms and nipples are identical; but the condom one is set to make a distinct _plop_ noise which meant no holes were being made, and the nipple one is set to make a _thunk_ noise so that it makes the holes so the babies can drink what's in the bottle.  The inspector first checks the nipple machine and he hears _thunk thunk thunk thunk thunk thunk_. Not noticing anything weird going on, he writes down everything is ok and moves onto the condom machine.  The machine is making the sounds _plop plop plop plop thunk plop plop plop plop thunk_. This alerts the inspector and tells the supervisor, "You're making a hole in every fifth condom!". "Yeah, it really boosts our baby bottles sales".
A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly afterward, she told him she was pregnant.   Not wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the baby there.   "But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she asked.   He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 'spaghetti' on the back.   I'll take care of expenses."   Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy.   Six months went by and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means."   The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you."   Later that evening, the doctor came home, read the postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack. Paramedics rushed him to the ER.  The lead medic stayed back to comfort the wife.   He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest.   So the wife picked up the card and read, "'Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - Two with sausage and meatballs, two without.'"
The funeral director...  Schwartz dies and is brought to the local funeral home to be laid out.  The funeral director carts him in and begins to undress the body, but when he pulls off the man's pants- he can't believe what he sees! Mr. Schwartz has easily got the largest penis he's ever seen. I mean- HUGE!  "I can't believe the size of this thing," he thinks. "Nobody would ever believe this!"

That night he gets home and can't wait to show his wife.   "Honey! Look at THIS!"   She takes one look and screams- "Oh my God! Schwartz is dead!!!"

The husband begs, "Can't it wait?" The wife relents.  They are having sex when the man asks for a blow job. She remembers the mess in the kitchen and, seeing an opportunity, says, "Okay, but I don't want to see a single dish in that sink tonight." He eagerly agrees.  The wife gives her husband a blow job, and when she's done, the man pulls out a blindfold. Surprised, the wife purrs, "What are you going to do to me?"  Perplexed, the husband responds: "You said you didn't want to see the dishes."
When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard... A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.   Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.   The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave.  Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."  He listened a while longer, and said, "There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."   So the magistrate kept listening, "There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."  Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate.   He stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

He sees the girl walking toward him, so he covers himself with the newspaper he happened to be reading. The girl comes up to him and asks, "Hey mister, What's that under your newspaper?" Thinking quickly, the man replies. "A bird." The girl accepts his answer and continues walking down the beach.  The man goes back to reading his newspaper and before long, he ends up falling asleep.   When he awakens, he finds himself in excruciating pain and laying in a hospital room. With him in the room are two police officers who begin questioning the man about what happened. The man says, "I have no idea. I was lying on the beach and this little girl asked me a question, I guess I dozed off because the next thing I know I woke up here."   Still looking for answers, the police end up going to the beach to find the little girl. They end up locating her and begin questioning her about the man. The little girl tells them the same story the man in the hospital told them. "What did you do after that?" they asked. After a pause, the little girl replies, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with his bird and it spit on me. So, I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire!"   
Got an In-built fan in the Clock Yeah, I died yesterday and went to hell and sure enough, hell was just as I expected. There was fire and brimstone everywhere, pits of lava holding people who were screaming in agony, little red guys with pointy tails chasing people and poking them with flame tipped pitchforks. Everything that is....except the red door. I was walking towards the door when all of a sudden there was a flash of light and smoke, and who stood there but an 8 foot tall devil.  He looked at me, cocked an eyebrow and said....."David, ole buddy. How ya doing my friend? Everything ok, everything to your liking, hmmmmm?" I shrugged. He then said, "follow me please" and he opened the red door. Behind the red door was a long hallway, the walls shimmering with heat, flames licking out from beneath some of the doors. As I followed the devil, we passed a door with lettering stating "Devil's Office". A bit farther there was one saying "Waiting Room", this one he opened, ushered me in, and told me to have a look around while he handles an incident.  As I looked around, I saw a clock on the wall with my name on it, but it wasn't running. I also saw two others, one for Lance and one for Costa, these were slowly running backwards. As I looking at the clocks, the door burst open and there stood the Devil . "So, do you have any questions David?"  "Yeah I do" I said. "I see my clock, but it's not running." He replied, "that's cause you're dead." Then I said, "I saw the clocks for Lance and Costa, there were moving slowly backwards." He said "That's cause each time someone masturbates, they lose a little bit of their life." "Oh, I see" I replied, "where's Marc's Clock?"  "Oh, that one's in my office....Use it as a fan."
A very elderly couple is having an elegant dinner to celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary. The old man leans forward and says softly to his wife, “Dear, there is something that I must ask you. It has always bothered me that our tenth child never quite looked like the rest of our children. Now I want to assure you that these 75 years have been the most wonderful experience I could have ever hoped for, and your answer cannot take that all that away. But, I must know, did he have a different father?” The wife drops her head, unable to look her husband in the eye, she paused for a moment and then confessed. “Yes. Yes he did.” The old man is very shaken, the reality of what his wife was admitting hit him harder than he had expected. With a tear in his eye he asks “Who? Who was he? Who was the father?” Again the old woman drops her head, saying nothing at first as she tried to muster the courage to tell the truth to her husband. Then, finally, she says, “You.”

Wanted to tease the crew's thirst, he unscrewed the bottle, and offered a crew member some. Before the crew member drank, he put the cap back on and mocked the sailer. He decided to do it again to some others. When he offered the next crew member a drink, the member asked the pirate, "Who are you?" Caught off gaurd by the question, Thuh dropped the bottle cap as it rolled over to Tain, who picked it up. Thuh looked straight into the crew member's Eyes while holding his hand out to Tain for his cap back, and said, "Look at me, look at me! I am Thuh. Cap, Tain, now!"
Two Irishman were fishing on a lake... ...when one of them caught a mysterious, ancient-looking bottle. Upon taking the bottle off the line, a genie popped out of it and said, "I really don't have time for this three wishes nonsense. You get one wish between the two of you, so make it good."  The fisherman who caught the bottle immediately blurts out, "I wish every body of water on Earth were made of beer!"  The genie snapped his fingers and said, "Done." and then disappeared.  Then the second fisherman smacked his buddy over the head and yelled, "You idiot! Now we have to pee in the boat!".
Confession time... A man goes to confession:   "Father, I may need to confess- but I'm not really sure."    "Tell me, my son."   Well, Father, you know I'm a happily married man, but I met a woman a few weeks ago and this morning, I was at her place, helping her unclog her sink when, I don't know what happened! Next thing- we're naked and in bed together! But Father- we didn't have sex... I just kinda, you know, rubbed it around on top a little."   "Ah, well, in the eyes of The Lord, that's still considered adultery. Now, I want you to say ten Hail Mary's, three Our Father's and I want you to put $100 in the poor box on the way out."   Then man leaves the confessional, walks up to the poor box, pulls out a large bill and palms it across the top briefly before returning it to his pocket. The priest sees him do this and comes charging out!   "Now, Mickey! I saw that! You put that money in there like I told you!   "But Father! You just told me rubbing it across the top was the same as sticking it in!"
Genie's Wish A couple was golfing one day on a very, very exclusive golf course, lined with million dollar houses. On the third tee the husband said, "Honey, be very careful when you drive the ball don't knock out any windows. It'll cost us a fortune to fix."   The wife teed up and shanked it right through the window of the biggest house on the course. The husband cringed and said, "I told you to watch out for the houses. Alright, let's go up there, apologize and see how much this is going to cost."   They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, "Come on in." They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer. A man on the couch said, "Are you the people that broke my window?"   "Uh, yeah. Sorry about that," the husband replied.   "No, actually I want to thank you. I'm a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. You've released me. I'm allowed to grant three wishes -- I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself."   "OK, great!" the husband said. "I want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life." "No problem-it's the least I could do. And you, what do you want?" the genie said, looking at the wife. "I want a house in every country of the world," she said.   "Consider it done," the genie replied.   "You know what, genie, maybe we can repay you by making one of YOUR wishes come true... what's your wish, genie?" the husband said.   "Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, I haven't had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife."   The husband looks at the wife and said, "Well, we did get a lot of money and all those houses, honey. I guess I don't care." The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours.   After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife, and said, "How old is your husband, anyway?"   "35," she replied.   "And he still believes in genies? That's amazing!" 
An old lady dies and goes to heaven... When standing by the gates, she asks the Guardian:  - "Why are there 2 doors, one blue and one red?"  - "Well, the blue one is the entrance to the Heavens, while the red one leads to Hell. You may choose any of the two."  Meanwhile, drilling noises and loud screams are heard coming from behind the blue door...  - "What in the Lord's name is this?!" - asks the old lady.  - "It's just a new soul that is getting its back drilled in order to give it wings."  The old lady is now having second thoughts about that blue door. Out of a sudden, more agonizing screams are heard, also coming from behind the blue door.  - "What's happening?! Why am I hearing more screams?"  - "Don't mind that, my lady. It's just another soul that is getting its head drilled to get its halo."  - "How horrible! I don't want to go to Heaven anymore. I want to go to Hell!"  - "But my lady, the Devil has a reputation for raping! He will most likely rape you too!"  - "Fuck that, at least I have the holes already."  
The Soldier and the Nun A soldier ran up to a nun, Out of breath he asked,  "Please, may I hide under your skirt. I'll explain later."  The nun agreed. A moment later two Military Police officers ran up and asked, "Sister, have you seen a soldier?"  The nun replied, "He went that way."  After the Military Police officers ran off, the soldier crawled out from under her skirt and said, 'I can't thank you enough Sister. You see, I don't want to go to war to Iraq."  The nun said, "I understand completely."  The soldier added, "I hope I'm not rude, but you have a great pair of legs!"  The nun replied, "If you had looked a little higher, you would have seen a great pair of balls....I don't want to go to Iraq either!

Statues There are these two beautiful marble  statues on either side of a big open piazza. For centuries they have stood frozen, starring longingly into each other's eyes.   One day the gods look down upon them with pity and decide to grant them one hour of mortal life.  The statues, overwhelmed with joy, rush across the square and into each others arms and immediately run off into a bush to fulfill their greatest desires.   After about a half an hour of rustling around in the bushes they emerge, panting and sweaty.   "Wow" says the one statue, "that was amazing"  "A dream come true" says the other "but we've got a half an hour left, what should we do now?" "I know" the first responds "this time I'll hold the pigeon down while you shit on it"

Leaving the grocery store I went to the supermarket today , and I was there for literally 5 minutes. When I came out there was a cop writing a parking ticket. So I went up to him and said, "Come on, buddy, how about giving a guy a break?" He ignored me and continued writing the ticket. So I called him a pencil-necked Dick headed cop. He glared at me and started writing another ticket for worn tires!  So I then asked him if his psychiatrist makes him lie face down on the couch cause he's so ugly. He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket!  This went on until he had placed 5 tickets on the winshield... the more I insulted him, the more tickets he wrote. I didn't care. My car was parked around the corner.

A doctor, a lawyer, and an architect were arguing about who had the smartest dog. A doctor, a lawyer, and an architect were arguing about who had the smartest dog. They decided to settle the issue by getting all the dogs together and seeing whose could perform the most impressive feat.  "Okay, Rover," ordered the architect, and Rover trotted to a table and in four minutes constructed a complete scale model of a cathedral out of toothpicks. The architect slipped Rover a cookie, and everyone agreed that it was a pretty impressive performance.  "Hit it, Spot," commanded the doctor. Spot lost no time in performing an emergency Caesarean on a cow. Three minutes later the proud mother of a healthy little heifer was all sewed up and doing fine. Not bad, conceded the onlookers, and Spot got a cookie from the doctor.  "Your turn, Fella," said the lawyer. Over went Fella, screwed the other two dogs, took their cookies, and went to lunch.

As the Air Force guy is about to leave, the Navy guy says "you know, in the Navy they teach us to wash our hands after we use the bathroom."

Then I served my country in Iraq. And now I spend my days reading to the residents of a retirement home.”  The guy is flabbergasted.

A mother is concerned about her sons future ... so she goes to here priest and says "father, I'm concerned for my boy! He doesn't seem to have any ambitions and I'm concerned he won't amount to anything!"  So the father says to her "do not worry, take me to your home and I shall put your mind at ease."  So she takes him to her house and the priest asks her son to go outside for a minute. Then, he turns to the mother and says " now we shall find out what kind of future he will have" The priest then takes out four items; a dollar coin, a playboy,  a bottle of jack Daniels with a shot glass, and a bible. He then places them on a nearby dresser and tells the mother to hide in the bathroom.  Once in there, the woman asks "why are we hiding and what was with those four items?" The priest then says "The four items are there to test the boy. If he takes the dollar, then he will be a successful business man but betray all his friends and colleagues just to make a buck. If He takes the playboy, then he will be a womanizer and never show an ounce of respect for women. If he takes the whisky, then he will be an alcoholic and find solace only in the bottom of a bottle. Finally, if he takes the Bible, he will be a man of god and act on behalf of the church."  As the pastor finished his explanation, the son walked in, looking for the two of them. He sees the four items on the dresser, looks around, then stares at the items while his mother and pastor watch in anticipation. After a couple more moments, the boy moves towards the dresser and makes his choice. First he grabs the dollar coin and puts it in his pocket, then he pours a shot and drinks it, finally he takes the playboy, puts it in the Bible, and walks out of the room to find his mom and the pastor.  The pastor is stunned and speechless at what he just saw. Then his mother exclaims "OH MY LORD, he's going to be a politician!!!"

A Russian and an Irish wrestler A Russian and an Irish wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic gold medal. Before the final match, the Irish wrestler's trainer came to him and said 'Now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has. It ties you up in knots. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished.'  The Irishman nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the Irishman and the Russian circled each otherseveral times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward,grabbing the Irishman and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.  Suddenly, there was a Long, High Pitched Scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Irishman collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match.  The trainer was astounded.When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked 'How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!'  The wrestler answered 'Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.'  The trainer exclaimed 'Oh, so that's what finished him off?!!'  'Not really. You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls'  
A mathematician, philosopher, and an idiot die and go to heaven They arrive at the Pearly Gates and St. Peter greets them with a smile, but the devil is standing beside them. The three men stand there looking very confused. Saint Peter tells them that heaven is getting very crowded. "You must ask a question or give a problem that the devil cannot answer correctly to go to heaven, otherwise-you will go to hell" he says. The three men agree and the devil approaches each of them separately. So the mathematician thinks for a while and give the devil a problem. The devil solves it and hands it right back to him. With a snap of Satan's fingers... he was gone The devil then approaches the philosopher and says for him to give him any sophisticated philosophical idea, and he'll explain it. So the philosopher does this and gives it to the devil. The devil, again, explains it and the philosopher goes to hell. Finally, the devil goes up to the idiot The idiot declares, "Get me a chair." The devil complies and gets the idiot a chair. "Alright, now drill seven holes in it." Again the devil complies and drills seven holes. Then, the idiot sits down in the chair and he farts. "Alright," the idiot declared. "Which hole did my fart come out of?" The devil was taken aback, and stood confused at the idiot. "Uhh, that one!" The devil said as he pointed to a random hole.  "No...My asshole!"

A father and his 6-year-old son are walking down the street, and they come across two dogs having sex.  The boy is shocked by what he sees and asks his father "Daddy, what are they doing?"  The father, not wanting to lie to his son, says "they're just making a puppy." "OK" says the son, and the father is relieved that he doesn't probe further. The next day, the son bursts into his parents' room and sees them having sex.  The father jumps up and quickly covers himself.  Knowing he's in for an interesting talk, walks downstairs with him and they sit at the dining room table.  His son asks him "Daddy, what were you and mommy doing?" Again, wanting to be honest with his son, he says "me and mommy were making a baby." His son pauses for a moment, thinking, and then replies "flip mommy over, I want a puppy!"     EDIT:sorry if its a repost.
A man died of a heart attack one day... His wife knew the exact tombstone her husband wanted but was worried about how she was going to pay for it. With the combination of her husband dying and the financial issues she was facing, she suffered a severe mental breakdown. As she was crying in her bed one night, she felt a presence next to her. It was the ghost of her husband.  "There, there" said the husband. "You know I already paid for that tombstone, right?"  "Really?" The wife said with an excited smile.  "Yeah," replied the husband.  "It's on me."
Sid and Irv Sid and Irv are business partners. They make a deal that whichever one dies first will contact the living one from the afterlife. So Irv dies. Sid doesn’t hear from him for about a year, figures there is no afterlife. Then one day he gets a call. It’s Irv. ‘So there is an afterlife! What’s it like?’ Sid asks. ‘Well, I sleep very late. I get up, have a big breakfast. Then I have sex, lots of sex. Then I go back to sleep, but I get up for lunch, have a big lunch. Have some more sex, take a nap. Huge dinner. More sex. Go to sleep and wake up the next day.’ ‘Oh, my God,’ says Sid. ‘So that’s what heaven is like?’ ‘Oh no,’ says Irv. ‘I’m not in heaven. I’m a bear in Yellowstone.

3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp... One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms "You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."   The first guy immediately blurts out "I want a billion dollars." POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50   The second man thinks for a bit, then says "I want to be the richest man alive." POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.   The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says "I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life." POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish.  First guy says: "I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth." POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.  Second guy says "I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want." POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.  Third guy says "I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die." POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.  First guy does, and after a while says "I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die." POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.   Second guy says "I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever." POOF, he looks younger already.  Third guy smiles triumphantly and says "My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth." POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.  The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.   First guy is ecstatic: "I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."   Second guy smiles and says "Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."   Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:  "Guys, I think I fucked up."
Ishmael is lying on his death bed... ...at the ripe old age of 97. He weakly raises his head and, through whispered, labored breaths, asks, "Where is my wife, Elena?"  "Oi vey, I am here, my love," whimpers the elderly woman as she clutches her husband's hand.  "This is good," says Ishmael. "And what of my son, Abraham? Is he here?"  "I sit here, you meshuggener old man," says Abraham, laughing despite his grief.  "You are a good boy, Abraham," whispers Ishmael. "And my darling daughter Sarah, where is she?"  "Papa, I love you!" cries Sarah as she draws a tissue to her face.  "And my grandchildren? Ezekial, Ruth, Emmanuel, Seraphine, Bartholomew?"  "We are all here, grandpapa!" the children cry in unison.  "So my family, all my family, is here with me now?" asks Ishmael.  "Yes, of course, dear," soothes Elena.  "Then why is the light on in the kitchen?"
In my early 20s, I was a scumbag - no car, no house, no job. I lived at with my girlfriend's apartment, and sometimes I'd even borrow her car when I went out to cheat on her. I say "borrow", but I didn't exactly ask her for permission.  She worked as a bank teller, so I'd simply wait till she fell asleep -- Then I'd sneak into the night.  When I returned, I'd adjust the seat, radio, and mirrors back how they were before.  The less questions, I figured, the better, but I grew less careful over time.    First, she complained that her AC settings were unreliable; I agreed, bemoaning the shoddy electronics in European cars.  Later, she started to swear her seat was never in *exactly* the same position; that was the first time I told her she was delusional.  She never brought up her seat position after that.  It worked so well that I kept at it.  She began to trust me more than she trusted herself; I could practically get away with anything.  Sometimes I would get home only seconds before the sound of her alarm.   Then one morning she went out to the car, came right back inside, and dragged me by the collar out of the apartment; I guess manipulation only goes so far.    As I sat on the curb and mulled it over, one thought crowded out the rest:  it was painfully likely that the gaslight was up.

Rats! A man walks into a second hand shop in Boston. He finds nothing really of interest until he spies a small statue of a rat that made of solid brass and weighs about five pounds.  "How much?" he asks the old man behind the counter. "Well now," says the clerk. "That's an interesting piece you're holding there. It'll be $30 for the item itself- and $1000 for the story." The man doesn't think twice. "Tell you what, Pops, I'll take the rat and you keep your story!"   The man leaves the store holding his new treasure and decides to walk down to the harbor since it's such a nice day.   Suddenly, as he passes a sewer grate, a plump rat scurries out and begins to follow him. Seconds later, two more. The man quickens his pace. The more sewer grates he passes, the more rats leap out and begin to follow. He panics and begins to run. More rats pour out- and then more! He sees the masts of tall ships getting closer and he bolts. Glancing quickly behind him he sees a vast carpet of rats growing by the second! Now he's running full tilt. Thousands of rats fill the street behind him! He's running all out, the weight of the brass rat is heavy in his hands as he sees the pier ahead. Giving one final push, the man leaps with the last of his strength and lands precariously atop a pier pole, just as the army of rats swarm over the dock and into the water where they all drown.   Back at the shop, a small bell rings as the man staggers back in, covered with sweat.   "Hey.. (pant... pant) old man... I... I need to know-"   "Ah", says the clerk with a sly grin. "I knew you'd be back for the story!"   The man shakes his head. "No... fuck that. I...I need to know- do you have any brass lawyers?"
A man wakes hungover A man wakes up in his bed with a terrible hangover. He looks to his bedside table and finds some ibuprofen and a glass of water. He glances around the bedroom and sees that it is cleaner than usual and his work clothes are laid out. He pops the ibuprofen and washes it down with water, and finds a note stuck to the bottom of the glass.  "Hey, honey, I ran to the store, there's breakfast downstairs, I'll be right back XOXO."  Upon getting dressed and getting his wits, he goes downstairs to find that everything is immaculate. He enters the dining room to find his son at the table eating breakfast, on the table is a buffet of eggs, bacon, pancakes, fruit, yogurt, the whole nine yards.  Still foggy and hungover, he plops down at the table, glances around at the pristine home. His son asks, "How are you feeling?"  "What the hell happened last night?"  "Well, you came home, stumbling drunk. You knocked on your own door, waking everyone up. You knocked over, not one, but TWO bookcases. You also puked all over yourself while you were puking into the litter box. You were a total mess."  Dumbfounded and glancing around, he asked, "then what is all of this? The food, everything is clean, I'm confused..."  "Oh, yeah, well, mom was trying to take your puke covered clothes off and put you to bed, and as she was taking your pants off, you yelled, 'GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME, WOMAN!!! I'M A MARRIED MAN!"
An old man takes his usual seat at the bar. This time, he's got an unusually large grin on his face. As the bartender brings his drink, he asks, "What's got you in such a good mood today?"  The old man replies, "When I was 20, I couldn't move my pecker even if I used both hands. When I was 40, I could get it to go about 10 degrees. When I was 60, I could push it down about halfway. I just turned 70, and I couldn't believe it. . .I nearly got it pointed to the ground earlier this morning. With one hand!"  The bartender was more than a little confused about this and asked him why that would make him so happy. The old man smiled broadly as he took a swig of his beer, looked the bartender right in the eye and said, "Can you imagine how strong I'm going to be when I'm 80?!"
Tired of waiting a sick elderly man bursts into a doctors office Interrupting the doctor's current visit the elderly man blurts out "I THINK I HAVE A PARASITE! What can I do to get better?"  Clearly annoyed, the doctor dismisses his current patient and says to the elderly man "you can only beat a parasite at his own game, therefore the only action you can take is to come over here and suck my dick". With this, the doctor drops his pants and eagerly waits.  Desperate, the elderly man gives the doc a solid blow with a rim job for good measure. Upon completion the man asks "how long before the parasite dies?"  "Oh", replied the doctor, "it probably won't die, I just wanted head"  "WHAT? YOU TRICKED ME?!? That's not every doctorly of you."  The doctor responds, "I'll start being more doctorly when you start behaving more patiently"
