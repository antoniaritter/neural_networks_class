He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his pack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, "Jesus is watching you."  He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard,  "Jesus is watching you." Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. "Did you say that?", he hissed at the parrot.  "Yep," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I'm just trying to warn you."  The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?"

'Well, to tell you the truth,' says the Pope, 'they never let me drive at the Vatican , and I'd really like to drive today.'  "I'm sorry, Your Holiness, but I cannot let you do that. I'd lose my job! What if something should happen?" protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.  'Who's going to tell?' asks the Pope with a smile.  Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 205 kms. (Remember, the Pope is Argentinian,)(and Fangio the famous racer was Argentinian.)  "Please slow down, Your Holiness," pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens.  "Oh, dear God, I'm going to lose my licence -- and my job!', moans the driver.  The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches; but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.  'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher.  The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going 205 kph.  'So bust him,' says the Chief.  'I don't think we want to do that. He's really important,' said the cop.  The Chief exclaimed, 'All the more reason!'  'No, I mean really important,' said the cop with a bit of persistence.  The Chief then asked, 'Who do you have there, the mayor?'  Cop: 'Bigger.'  Chief: ' A senator?'  Cop: 'Bigger.'  Chief: 'The President?'  Cop: 'Bigger.  'Well,' said the Chief, 'who is it?'  Cop: 'I think it's God!'  The Chief is even more puzzled and curious, 'What makes you think it's God?'  Cop: 'His chauffeur is the Pope!

Jessie Jackson and OJ went to a speech by the Pope. (NSFW) Jessie Jackson and OJ Simpson went to watch a speech from the Pope. They were sitting pretty high up in the back minding their own business and were eating sunflower seeds. They had nowhere to throw them away so they were spitting them on the floor.   As the speech went on Jessie Jackson said, "I'm gonna head down there and meet the Pope." OJ told him not to because it would take too long to get through a crowd of people. Jackson went anyway.  About 30 minutes later he finally made it up to the Pope and sure as shit, OJ sees the Pope bless Jessie Jackson with the sign of the cross.  Jessie makes his way back to OJ and he had to give him credit. "Wow, that's pretty cool. You were blessed by the Pope!"  Jessie said, "Well that's not exactly true. As he was giving me the sign of the cross he had a message for us." OJ was surprised, "Really? For both of us? What was it?"  *Jessie makes the sign of the cross for each statement*  "Get back up there, pick up those sunflower seeds, get that other nigger, and get the hell out of here!"

"Rabbi, why are the Jews so hated?" At a meeting in a synagogue, a young Jew asked the wise old Rabbi: "Rabbi, why do people hate us so much?" The Rabbi thinks for a while and says "That is an interesting question. We will all talk about it tomorrow over some vodka! Each one of you shall bring a bottle of fine vodka, so we can mix it all up in a big pot and drink, discuss, and then the answer will be clear."  The young Jew went home and thought to himself "if everyone else is going to bring a bottle of vodka, I'll just bring a bottle of water and no one will be the wiser." Next day the young Jew showed up with a vodka bottle filled with water, anxious to see what answer the Rabbi would provide to his question. The Rabbi started to pour all the vodka together in one pot and began stirring it. The young Jew got impatient - "Please, Rabbi! What is the answer to my question? Why do people hate us so much?" The Rabbi then filled a cup, gave it to the young Jew and said "Drink this now!" The young Jew drank the cup and said "But this is just wat**e**r!" And the Rabbi said "and that is why the p**e**opl**e** hat**e** us"

Finally, they gave in, and sent him to one of the best math-oriented schools in the city, which happened to be Christian.  At the end of the first semester, the boy showed his parents his report card, and they were amazed. He had gotten all A's in everything, even math!  "How'd you do it?" His dad asked him.
