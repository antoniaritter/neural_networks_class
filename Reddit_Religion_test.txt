She started hitting him with her bag, shouting "Get lost you heretic!". Sad Jesus continued his soul saving quest.  Later on, he saw a gentleman in his mid forties in a suit holding a case, probably rushing to work in a corporation. "I bet he's lost in life and seeks directions and meaning", thought Jesus.  - Hi, I'm Jesus and I'm here to save you  - What? Piss off, I don't have time for this nonsense.  And again, sad Jesus walked away, disappointed.  Suddenly, in a park, he saw a group of young lads sitting on a bench. Though they had only one cigarette to share amongst five of them, they had a really good time. He came to them and began his speech:  - Hi, I'm... - Mate, 'bout time you rolled up, hit this!  Jesus took a puff and immediately let it out and started coughing.  - Nah mate, you gotta hold it!  Jesus inhaled.  - Hold it, hold it, hold it...Let it out!  He exhaled. Nice.  - Okay listen, I'm... - Nah mate, that's just the beginning, puff it!  Jesus took another puff.  - Hold it, hold it, hold it...Let it out!  And lo, he hath exhaled.  - Phew. Seriously guys, I just want... - Nah mate, you have to hit it three times to feel it, puff!  Jesus took a hit for the third time.  - Hold it, hold it, hold it...Let it out! - Oh damn... - Okay mate, say your thing - Hi, I'm Jesus and I'm here to save you - And that's what this shit's about, mate!
