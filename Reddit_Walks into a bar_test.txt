[long] A kangaroo walks into a bar... and says to the bartender, "gimme a beer."  The bartender is stunned at the sight of a talking kangaroo and doesn't move.  The kangaroo misinterprets this and says "I have money" while putting a $20 on the bar.  The bartender snaps to his senses and serves a beer.  He takes the $20, then goes in the back room to tell the manager what's going on.  "There's a talking kangaroo at the bar!  He ordered a beer and even paid!"  he said, holding up the $20.  "What should I do?"  he then asked.  The manager, figuring this was some kind of joke, rolled his eyes and dismissively said "keep the change", then went back to his paperwork.  The bartender thought about it for a moment and realized he might as well keep the $20; what're the chances this kangaroo would know the price of a beer?  When he returned to the bar, the kangaroo was done and said "gimme another beer" and put another $20 bill on the bar.  The bartender gives him another beer and takes the money, revelling at this lucky break.  He decides to chat up the kangaroo.  "So, here on business or pleasure?"  The kangaroo glares back at him and says "just trying to unwind."  Unfazed, the bartender jokingly continues, "Don't see many talking kangaroos in here!"  "I'm not surprised, $20 a beer is a rip-off" the kangaroo replies bitterly.
