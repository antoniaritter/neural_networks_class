Frustrated little Johnny decides that the next Friday he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend.\n\nSo Thursday night Johnny takes 2 ping pong balls and paints them black. The next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day just when the teacher says, \"here's this week's question,\" Johnny empties the bag onto the floor sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room. The entire class starts laughing.\n\nThe teacher says, \"Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?\"\n\nImmediately, little Johnny stands up and says, \"Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!\"",

I simply come to pet him and to keep him company and comb his mane. See that bucket over there? I even brought it earlier full of the best oats in all of Virginia!

    "selftext": "On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jacobs kissed his wife and said 'I'm off to work, Lydia. The guy should be here soon.'\n\nWouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. Mrs. Jacobs answered the door. 'Good morning, ma'am. You don't know me, but I've come to...' 'Oh yes, I know why you're here. Harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'He did? But I...' 'Come right in! No use wasting time .' 'Very well, then.'\n\nThe photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'As you may already know, I've made a specialty of babies.' 'Good, I'm glad,' said Mrs. Jacobs. 'That's just what Harry and I were looking for.'\n\n'I usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'The living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'Bathtub? Living room floor? No wonder it never worked for Harry and me.' 'Well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different angles, I think you'll be quite pleased with the results.'\n\n'I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' Mrs. Jacobs gasped nervously. 'Ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. I'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.' 'Don't I know!' said Mrs. Jacobs.\n\nThe photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'This one was done on top of a bus in downtown London,' he said, showing Mrs. Jacobs the picture. 'Oh my God!' exclaimed Mrs. Jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief.\n\n'And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' He showed Mrs. Jacobs another picture. 'She was difficult?' questioned Mrs. Jacobs. 'Extremely,' said the photographer. 'I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'Four and five deep!' Mrs. Jacobs was amazed. 'Yes,' said the photographer. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then, it started getting dark and I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. I just packed it all in.'\n\nMrs. Jacobs leaned forward. 'You mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'Yes, ma'am. Thank God, no real damage was done.\n\nWell, we'll get to work as soon as I set up my tripod.'\n\n'Tripod? ' Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now.\n\n'Of course. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much to big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Uh... ma'am???'",

This badge means I can go where I please, when I please, how I please! You have no authority when it comes to telling me where the fuck I can go! Have I made myself clear, boy?!”\n\nI politely nodded and went back about my business. A short time after, I heard a scream, looked up to see the DEA agent being chased by my big old mean bull. Every step, gaining, closing the gap between himself and the agent. It seemed as tho he would surely get gored before returning to safety. The officer was clearly terrified.\n\nI threw down my tools, ran to the fence and screamed at the top of my lungs....\n\n“YOUR BADGE! SHOW HIM YOUR  BADGE!!”\n\nSource: a comment on r/funny",

It was a really hot day and after enjoying the cool ocean water, they decided to sit at the bar under the straw hut.\n\nThey started to knock back a few Long Islands and other refreshing cocktails and they had a great time.\n\nGood ol' Paul excused himself from the missus and decided to take a leak. The queue for the restroom by the bar was too long, so he ran further up and saw the Department of Tourism building.\n\n He was about to burst, and hopping side to side, he asked the receptionist where the restroom is. \"Take a left turn down there\" she barely said in her thick Jamaican accent before Paul jetted off and entered the restroom.\n\nAt the urinal, he noticed that this tall dark Jamaican man has on his penis, the letters WY tattooed. \n\n\"How peculiar\", thought Paul.\n\nCuriously, Paul told the gentleman that he is on his honeymoon and as a surprise for his newly wed wife, he had her name on his penis tattooed to show his undying love and eternal loyalty to her. Paul then asked him \"So do you also have a wife named Wendy?\".\n\nThe man replied,  \"No, I work in the Tourism department, so it says WELCOME TO JAMAICA, ENJOY OUR BEACHES AND HAVE A NICE DAY\"",

This badge means I can go where I please, when I please, how I please! You have no authority when it comes to telling me where the fuck I can go! Have I made myself clear, boy?!”\n\nI politely nodded and went back about my business. A short time after, I heard a scream, looked up to see the DEA agent being chased by my big old mean bull. Every step, gaining, closing the gap between himself and the agent. It seemed as tho he would surely get gored before returning to safety. The officer was clearly terrified.\n\nI threw down my tools, ran to the fence and screamed at the top of my lungs....\n\n“YOUR BADGE! SHOW HIM YOUR  BADGE!!”",

He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.\n\nA few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.\n\nThe next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.\n\nDing-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.\n\nThe door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.\n\n“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”\n\n“Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.\n\n“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”\n\n“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk. “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",

Then he says to the second duck \"Hi, and what's your name?\" \"Dewey,\" came the answer. \"So how's your day been, Dewey?\" \"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. If I had the chance another day I would do the same again.\" So the bartender turns to the third duck and says, \"So, you must be Louie.\" \"No,\" growls the third duck, \"my name is Puddles, and don't ask about my day.\"",

Sitting on that ledge there is a bottle of Jack Daniels. First, you have to chug that, no pausing, no burping.”\n\nThe man, listening closely, gives the bartender a nod.\n\n“Second,” the bartender continued, “There’s a rabid dog out back. You have to wrestle it and pin it within fifteen minutes. Naturally, this is where most people fail.”\n\nThe man, slightly nervous, nods yet again. “Go on.”\n\nThe bartender continued. “Lastly, there’s an Eskimo Woman upstairs. If you can get her to have sex with you, the money is yours.”\n\nThe man, now intent on getting the money, immediately runs over to the ledge, opening the bottle of Jack Daniels. He chugs it down as the rest of the bar silently watches, before slamming the empty bottle back down with watery eyes. The bartender points him to the back door, where he stumbles over to before heading out back.\n\nBefore long, the horrible sounds of the man yelling and groaning can be heard, only drowned out by the louder barks and growls of the rabid dog. The sounds go on for about ten minutes as the bar patrons and the bartender all watch the back door intently, prepared to dial 911 before everything in the back goes silent and the man stumbles back inside, his clothes torn, covered in blood and bruises. He looks at the bartender, and asks with slurred speech:\n\n“Now where’s that Eskimo Woman I’m supposed to wrestle?”",

Their main gimmick was that they employed only the best 20 lawyers and for anonymity only referred to them by their number, 1 through 20. \n\nIn the height of their reputation there was a massacre; 300 people dead by a fire in an apartment building. While normally considered an accident, it was found that all 18 exits of the building were simultaneously blocked so none of the tenants could escape. Standing trial for this horrendous crime were 18 young men, all teenagers. To again respect anonymity, the press didn’t release any of the accused individuals’ names and simply referred to them by number.\n\nAs this case was deemed “un-loseable” by the DA, 20 to Life was called in to help sentence these teenagers to the longest possible prison sentence. Without delay, Lawyer 13 was sent out to consult on the case.\n\nAfter looking over the suspects, Lawyer 13 noticed something suspicious about of on the supposed criminals: Teenager 15 had lost both of his parents and his little brother in the fire. Thinking that there’s no way a teenager would murder his entire family, Lawyer 13 went to meet with Teenager 15 to get his side of the story before the trial. At this meeting, Teenager 15 broke down, saying that he was falsely accused of the crime along with two of his close friends: Teenagers 12 and 7. With alibis and witnesses to back up this claim, Lawyer 13 felt awful. How could he possibly be responsible for condemning three innocent boys to life in prison? \n\nWithout a moment’s hesitation Lawyer 13 called the firm manager, Lawyer 1, and refused to prosecute the eighteen teenagers. Lawyer 1, furious, reprimanded Lawyer 13 for not upholding the firm’s reputation. After a long scolding, Lawyer 1 angrily asked Lawyer 13 why he would possibly throw the case.\n\nWith a shaky voice came the response of 13: “For Teen 15.”",

    "selftext": "The  Descartes’ were hosting one of their fancy late night parties.  (Blaise) Pascal and (Pierre) Fermat were there; Blaise playing  the jester and making bets with passers-by about the craziest things  you could imagine, and Pierre taunting the English as usual. The  Descartes were renowned for these parties which usually went on well  into the night, and were especially famous for Madame Descartes’  elaborate dessert creations which were always immaculately presented  every hour exactly on the hour.\n\nMidnight  came and went, and the remaining guests started to gather as Pierre and  Rene struck up a friendly debate about the nature of existence. A hungry Blaise casually wandered over towards Madame Descartes' famed croquembouche pastry, even as he remained engrossed in the  intellectual spectacle taking place before him. Rene caught a glimpse of  Blaise out of the corner of his eye. \"Quelle horreur!\" he thought to  himself; Blaise was about to grab a profiterole and disturb his wife's creation, unwittingly causing a minor scandal! As a  gracious host, he couldn’t interrupt his vigorous repartee with Pierre to shout out a warning to Blaise (thereby embarrassing both his  friends), so his mind furiously raced for an alternative. As Pierre kept  on talking, Rene surreptitiously grabbed Fermat's book from the table (A copy of Diophantus), tore out some paper from the generous margins, scribbled down a note, and hurriedly directed his servant to  pass it on to Pascal. Just as the profiterole was about to reach  Blaise’s lips, the servant arrived and handed him the crumpled piece of paper.\n\nBlaise looked down upon the note; it simply read “I THINK THEY’RE FOR  1 AM!”",

Surprised by the vision in front of him, Mehmet naked, bending in all directions and angles, with a loud and deep voice, the sultan roared! \n-WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING, MEHMET???\n-Well hello sultan, I'm trying to fuck myself of course. But as you can see, it's not so easy.\n-WHAT ON EARTH IS IT YOU'RE SAYING? WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING? \n-Well you see sultan, everyone I've fucked have become rich and famous, and here I am, still a merchant. I though it was time for me to live the good life. \n-ARE YOU INSANE? WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR SEXUAL ACT WILL LEAD TO FORTUNE?\n-Dear sultan, for starters, I fucked all your 20 advisers only days before they became your advisers and now rich and famous. Just ask them if you dont believe me. \nConfused and baffled by this, the sultan goes back to his palace and gathered his advisers, and asked them if indeed what Mehmet told him was true. \nThe advisers denied it at first, but when the sultan threatened them, they all admitted they had been properly fucked by Mehmet only days before they got rich and famous. \nThe sultan felt sorry for Mehmet who is trying to fuck himself for richness, and demanded the advisers to share their wealth with Mehmet immediately. So they gathered 100 golden bricks and loaded them on a donkey which a servant was ordered to bring to Mehmet. \nThe following day, Mehmet is still trying to fuck himself, almost able to enter himself when he sees a donkey approaching, filled with gold on its back. \nJumping out of joy, Mehmet exclaimed \"I can't believe I got all of this gold from just the tip!",

That looks deep.”\n\nThe second guy says, “It sure does. Let’s throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We’ll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.”\n\nSo they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There’s no noise.\n\nThe first guy says, “Jeeez. That is really deep. I know, let’s throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.”\n\nSo they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait… and wait… Again, nothing.\n\nThey look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy gets a determined look on his face and says, “Hey, over here in the weeds, there’s a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in, it’s gotta make some noise.”\n\nSo the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again, not a sound comes from the hole.\n\nSuddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it’s legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.\n\nThe two men are astonished with what they’ve just seen and look at each other in amazement.\n\nThen, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them, “Hey, you two guys seen my goat out here?”\n\nThe first guy says, “You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!”\n\n“Nah”, says the farmer, “That couldn’t have been my goat. My goat was chained to a railroad tie.”",

That’s fine.”\n\nThe farmer said, “Sorry, I can’t do that. I went and spent it already.”\n\nTommy then said, “Okay, then, just bring me the dead horse.”\n\nThe farmer was surprised and asked Tommy, “Why? What ya gonna do with him?”\n\nTommy replied, “I’m going to raffle him off.”\n\nThe farmer laughed and said, “You can’t raffle off a dead horse! Who’d buy a ticket?”\n\nTommy answered, “Sure I can, just watch me. I just won’t tell anybody the horse is dead.”\n\nA month later, the farmer met up with Tommy again and asked, “What happened with that dead horse in the end. Did you raffle him off?”\n\nTommy said, “I sure did. I sold 500 tickets at $5 a piece.”\n\nThe farmer said, “Didn’t anyone complain?”\n\nTommy smiled and said, “Just the guy who won. So I gave him his $5 back.”",

    "selftext": "\nAfter Mrs. Jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jacobs kissed his wife and said 'I'm off to work, Lydia. The guy should be here soon.'\n\nWouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. Mrs. Jacobs answered the door. 'Good morning, ma'am. You don't know me, but I've come to...' 'Oh yes, I know why you're here. Harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'He did? But I...' 'Come right in! No use wasting time .' 'Very well, then.'\n\nThe photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'As you may already know, I've made a specialty of babies.' 'Good, I'm glad,' said Mrs. Jacobs. 'That's just what Harry and I were looking for.'\n\n'I usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'The living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'Bathtub? Living room floor? No wonder it never worked for Harry and me.' 'Well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different angles, I think you'll be quite pleased with the results.'\n\n'I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' Mrs. Jacobs gasped nervously. 'Ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. I'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.' 'Don't I know!' said Mrs. Jacobs.\n\nThe photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'This one was done on top of a bus in downtown London,' he said, showing Mrs. Jacobs the picture. 'Oh my God!' exclaimed Mrs. Jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief.\n\n'And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' He showed Mrs. Jacobs another picture. 'She was difficult?' questioned Mrs. Jacobs. 'Extremely,' said the photographer. 'I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'Four and five deep!' Mrs. Jacobs was amazed. 'Yes,' said the photographer. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then, it started getting dark and I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. I just packed it all in.'\n\nMrs. Jacobs leaned forward. 'You mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'Yes, ma'am. Thank God, no real damage was done.\n\nWell, we'll get to work as soon as I set up my tripod.'\n\n'Tripod? ' Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now.\n\n'Of course. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much to big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Ma'am...ma'am...good God, she's fainted!'",

    "selftext": "One rainy day, a very religious woman was standing on her front porch watching as the river across the street started to rise up its banks. A policeman drove down the road and saw her, pulled his cruiser up her drive, and got out.\n\n\"Excuse me miss,\" he called over to the woman, \"but the rains are gonna come down hard and they're predictin' a mighty flood. Do you have someone you can go stay with? Do you need a ride?\"\n\nThe woman calmly looked over to the officer and replied, \"Oh, I'm not worried. I place my faith in God, and I know he will deliver me from danger.\"\n\nThe officer shrugged and, considering the rest of the neighborhood he still needed to alert, continued on his way.\n\nLater that evening, the woman watched from her second-story bedroom window as the flood waters rose up over her porch and poured into the first floor of her house. The local fire-rescue team pulled up to her house in a boat and, seeing her in the window, called up to her.\n\n\"Ma'am, the river hasn't crested yet, and these waters are gettin' mighty dangerous. You have to come with us now and we'll take you to safety.\"\n\nStill calm, the woman called back, \"I'm not worried. I place my faith in God, and I know he will deliver me from danger.\"\n\nThe rescuers looked at each other and shrugged. The situation was getting too dangerous to waste time arguing, so they continued on their way.\n\nAround midnight, sitting on the roof of her house as the flood waters worked their way ever higher, the woman watched the searchlight of a helicopter dart from roof to roof until it landed on hers. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a rescue swimmer was lowered on a winch and held out a hand to the woman.\n\n\"Please, you must come with us. If you stay here you'll surely drown!\"\n\nBut the woman waved him off. \"I'm not worried. I place my faith in God, and I know he will deliver me from danger.\"\n\nAn hour later, the woman drowned.\n\nAs her spirit floated up to heaven, God welcomed her and said, \"Welcome, my child, and be at peace.\" But God could tell that something was troubling the woman. \"What is it my child? What is troubling you?\"\n\n\"Well...\" the woman began. \"My entire life I was very religious. I attended church every Sunday and prayed to you many times each and every day. I placed all my faith in you, even as the flood took my home and all my worldly belongings. Why...\" she stammered a bit, \"why didn't you deliver me from danger?\"\n\nGod looked her square in the face. \"I sent a police officer, a boat, and a helicopter. What more did you want?\"",

He at first disagreed, like anyone would, until they offered an enormous raise. He then of course accepted the money and this continued to happen for several months.\n\nEventually the exhibit grew less and less popular. The man in the suit had enjoyed all of the attention the park guests gave him so he tried to think of a way to bring back his former popularity. After a few minutes of planning, he started to climb the ropes until he was above the lion’s cage. This of course gathered the attention of the guests. \n\nHe started swinging from side to side to show off to the guests when he accidentally fell. After getting up from the fall he is greeted by a lion that appeared very hungry. The man in the suit was then attacked by the lion, to which he started yelling in fear. The lion covered his mouth and whispered, “Shut up or you’ll get us caught!”",

I only live in one room, but I have to clean the whole house.\nGerald - she wrote to her other son - I'm too old for travelling. I spend most of my time at home, so I rarely use Mercedes, moreover, the driver is so rude!\n\nDearest Donald - she wrote to her third son - you know exactly what brings your mother the greatest joy.

The man toured the resort and eventually came upon the cafeteria.\n\nThere was a sign which read, “Serving Lierogies and Lork tonight.”\n\nThinking about the food made the man hungry, so he went around looking for food. Strangely, in cafetaria he only found two signs that read; line for breakfast and line for dinner, both of which were closed since it was 12:30 PM.\n\nConfused and hungry, the man approached the employee and asked, “Where’s the lunchline?”",

Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last Arkansas family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address.\n\nThis place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though. Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain... We haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.\n\nAbout that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.\n\nYour sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother. Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.\n\nThree of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much out of the normal has happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove,\n\nMom.",

I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.\"\n\n\n\nThe doctor stares at him for a while then finally says \"Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?\"\n\n\n\nThe moth says,\"Your light was on.\"",

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. \n\nHe sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. \n\nHe moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  \n\nThe police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.  To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!\n\n Dumbfounded, the officer said, \"I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken.\" \"I doubt it,\" said the truly proud Redneck. \"Tonight I'm the designated decoy.\"",

I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.*\n\n*I have been finding real passion with Susie and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.*\n\n*But it's not only the passion. Dad she's pregnant.* \n\n*Don't worry though, Susie said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.*\n\n*Susie has also opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.*\n\n*In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Susie can get better. She deserves it.*\n\n*Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.*\n\n*Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.*\n\n*Love, Your son Tim.*\n\n*P.S.

Each Ent held in the hands a Palantir, the Crystal Ball used for long range communication that is now mass produced under the rule of Eldarion.\n\nThe High King gave a puzzled look at the Ents communicating with each other through the Palantiri, before uncontrollably laughing and falling off his throne.

Mind if I join you next week?\"\nNo one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says. \"Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.\" He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.\nThe woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.\nThey roll their eyes, but say, \"Okay.\" She's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp, and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. They congratulate her and invite her back the next week. She smiles, and says, \"I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\"\nThe next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she plays left-handed. The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They're totally amazed. They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. They invite her back again, but each man harbours a burning desire to beat her.\nThe third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed, and narrowly beats all three of them. The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong\nplay, they can't hold a grudge.\nThis woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\"\nThe lady blushes, and grins. \"When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,\" she replies. \"I like to switch back and forth.\"\n\"When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.\"\nThe guys think this is hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, \"What if it's pointing straight up?\"\nShe says, \"Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.\"",

They continued to watch until it reached the last number. and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.\n\nFinally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out.

She insisted on speaking with the bank manager to open a savings account because, “It’s a lot of money.”\n\nAfter a great deal of negotiating, the bank staff decided to humor her and finally ushered her into the manager’s office. The bank manager asked her how much she would like to deposit.\n\nTo his astonishment she replied, “£150,000!” and dumped the cash out of her bag on to his desk.\n\nThe manager was curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, “Madam, it is a little unusual for someone to be carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?”\n\nThe old lady replied, “Gambling.”\n\nThe manager then asked, “Gambling? What kind of gambling?”\n\nThe old woman said, “Well, for example, I’ll bet you £25,000 that your testicles are square.”\n\n“Ahem!” coughed the bank manager, “If you don’t mind me saying so, that’s a rather silly bet. You can never win that kind of bet.”\n\nThe old lady challenged him, “So, would you like to take my bet?”\n\n“If you insist,” said the bank manager. “I’ll be very happy to bet £25,000 that my testicles are not square!”\n\nThe little old woman said, “Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. as a witness?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied the bank manager.\n\nThat evening after work the bank manager started to have second thoughts about the bet and spent ages in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.\n\nThe next morning, at precisely 10 a.m., the little old woman appeared with her lawyer at the bank manager’s office. She introduced the lawyer to the head of the bank and repeated the bet: “£25,000 says the bank manager’s balls are square!”\n\nThe banker agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.\n\nThe little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. “Well, if you must,” said the bank manager, “£25,000 is a lot of money so you are entitled to be absolutely certain.”\n\nJust then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.\n\nThe bank manager said to the old lady, “What’s wrong with him?”\n\nShe replied, “Nothing, except I bet him £100,000 that at 10 a.m. today I would have the Bank manager’s balls in my hand.”",

The cod promises to grant George one wish. George decides he wants to be a shark, so wishes to become a shark. The cod grants George's wish and he transforms into a shark. Christian, being terrified of sharks, swims away in fear and the cod leaves too, leaving George all alone. A few days after losing Christian, he decides to try to find the cod. Soon, George finds the cod and begs it to return him to his prawn form. The cod grants his wish yet again and George becomes a prawn. After this, George seeks out Christian and tells him he's no longer a shark. Christian is of course wary of George and asks him how he can be sure he's not going to eat him. George then says to him, \"It's okay, I found cod, I'm a prawn again Christian\"",

He was acting just like the crewmen, swinging his little plastic tools around and swearing up a storm just like them. His mother wasn’t too pleased when she came to get him for lunch and overheard the kid saying loudly, “Fuckin’ shit, pass me another goddamn nail.” His mother grabbed him by the hand, pulled him inside the house, and said, “Giuseppe, I’m warning you—if your papa ever hears you talking like that, you’re gonna be plenty sorry.” Hearing of Giuseppe’s misbehavior on his return home from work, the father said, “Son, I’ve got to teach you a lesson. Go out in the back and get me a switch.” “Fuck you,” said Giuseppe, “that’s the electrician’s job!”",

The three passengers seem to be panic-stricken, but not in any medical distress.

The rightfully embarrassed driver apologizes profusely, and gets let off with a warning. \n\nBefore they drive off, however, the patrolman raises his eyebrows, gestures towards the passengers, and asks, \"By the way, what's the deal with them?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the driver sheepishly responds, \"we just got off the 95.\"",

That is impressive,\" says the bartender.\n\nThe Lobster puts his briefcase up on the bar, deftly opens it with his claws, and produces a document that looks to be at least 100 pages. He slides it to the bartender.\n\n\"This is a legal contract that covers all the questions usually asked of me whenever I walk into a bar. I've just finished a pretty rough case and would like to get to drinking as soon as possible, so if we could skip over the usual jokes and just get through this without delay I'd be much obliged.\"\n\nThe bartender looks at the lobster carefully, but soon nods in agreement.\n\n\"Fair enough, mate,\" he says. \"Let's work through this.\"\n\nThe bartender flips over the cover page and starts reading aloud.\n\n\"'Point 1: I am a lobster of legal drinking age and you'll find in Annex A a copy of my legally acceptable identification.' Well, okay, no problems there.\n\n\"'Point 2: You can serve me more than water and are absolved of any misfortune that befalls me while drinking at your establishment.' What's your favourite drink?\"\n\n\"Vermouth, usually,\" says The Lobster, \"but I'm hoping for a few stiff glasses of whiskey tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" the bartender continues reading, \"'Point 3: We've established I am a lawyer, and therefore reasonably wealthy. This should assuage any fears you might have about my capability to settle my tab, but I am happy to pay up front if you have any concerns.'\"\n\nThe Lobster slaps a crisp $50 bill onto the bar.\n\n\"Well alright then,\" says the bartender.\n\n\"There's just one more point to read and agree to,\" says The Lobster.\n\nThe bartender raises an eyebrow, seeing that he's still on page one and there are a considerable amount of pages left to read, and quickly flips through a number of the pages to confirm that there is, in fact, writing on every page.\n\n\"Look,\" he says, \"before I read the rest, I have to ask: why the large clause?\"\n\nThe Lobster gives a little sigh.\n\n\"Dunno,\" he says. \"I'm a lobster. I guess I've always had them.\"",

    "selftext": "In the days before cell phones, a businessman wants to keep his wife \"entertained\" while he's away on business trips. He tends to be away for a couple of weeks at a time, so he was always worried about his wife cheating on him. The man headed over to his local sex shop to see what he can find.\n\n\nThe shop was small, a little old, much like the man who ran the shop. The old man asked him what he was looking for, and the businessman explained his predicament. \"Hmm,\" said the old man, \"we have dildos, vibrators, attatchments, everything you could think of. But I don't think we have anything that could keep her entertained that long... except... no, no, nevermind...\" The businessman begs him to show him what he meant, and the old man pulls out an ornately carved wooden box. But when he opens it, it just looks like any other dildo. Which the businessman says to him. The old man smiles and says, \"ah, but watch this! Voodoo dick, the door.\" Suddenly, the dildo rose from its box, hovered over to the door, and began to screw the keyhole. It wasn't until the wood started to crack that the old man said, \"Voodoo dick, back to your box!\" The businessman, excited, asked him how much it would cost; at first, he didn't want to sell, but several hundred dollars ended up changing his tune.\n\n\nWhen it came time for the businessman to leave for another trip, he gave his wife the dildo, telling her that if she ever felt lonely while he was gone, simply say \"voodoo dick, my pussy.\" Now, after a few days, feeling horny and a little foolish, she wife opens the box and says, \"voodoo dick, my pussy.\" The dildo rises from his box and sets straight to work. After a few of the best orgasms of her life, she decides she's done and goes to pull the dilso out of her. It doesn't budge no matter how hard she tries. He forgot to tell her how to turn it off. Panicked, the wife throws on a skirt and drives off to the hospital, but has another orgasm on the way, nearly swerving off the road. To her horror, she sees police light in her rear view, and pulls over.\n\n\nSeeing the woman's disheveled state, the officer says, \"how much have you had to drink, ma'am?\" She says, \"You don't understand, officer, haven't drank anything! There's a voodoo dick stuck inside me and it won't stop screwing!!\"\n\n\"Yeah right,\" says the cop, \"voodoo dick, my ass.\"",

Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  \n \n\nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  \n \n\n\"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.  \n\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said, \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\"",

    "selftext": "Such number as may be deemed to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement:\n\nWhereas the party of the first part, also known as “Lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “Light Bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed-upon duties, i.e., the illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.\n\nThe aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:\n\n1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, step-stool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every reasonable caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed-upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.\n\n2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.\n\n3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“New Light Bulb”). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in Step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.\n\nNOTE: The above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “The Firm.”",

The lady was beautiful and had every feature a man would ask for. The man and camel went up to her to see if she was alright.\n\n“Are you ok ma’am?” said the man.\n\nThe lady looked up to the man and said “sir, I have been left by my group of people, and I have finished my final drops of water.” Her eyes landed on the man’s water. “Will you please, kind sir, give me some of that water of yours?

Say 3 Hail Marys, 2 Our Fathers, and return the lumber.\"  Next Sunday the man goes into the confessional.   \"I know you told me to return the lumber,  but when I got to the lot, I don't know,  I took some more.\"  The Preist says,  \"Clearly,  you need a stronger penance.   I want you to pray the Rosary,  recite the Queen of Heaven,  and take back that lumber!\"  Next Week,  the man comes in.   \"Father,  I did my penance,  but when I returned to the lot,  the lumber was just sitting there.   I couldn't help myself.   It's all at my house now.\"  Grieved,  the Priest says,  \"My son,  don't you know that your immortal soul is in danger.   It's time for extreme measures.  Tell me,  do you know how to make a novena?\"  \"No Father, \" the man replies contritely, \"but if you have the plans. I have the lumber.\"",

I run up to the 8 floor and open the door. Shes laying naked on the bed, something that she never did for me in 8 years of marriage. So im looking under the bed, in the closet, etc. but cant find no one. So i go on the balcony for a smoke and that guy is hanging on the railing ! I go ballistic and hit on his hands with my shoes ! He falls but the trees are saved him. So i completely lose myself and throw the mini-refrigerator after him, sadly the cable of that thing wraps around my leg and pulls me down with it. BAM, Dead.'' \n\nPetrus laughs and says: Haha ok come in !\n\nThe second one starts: I,ve been a window cleaner all my life and never has anything bad happend to me but today i was cleaning the windows in the 9th floor when suddenly the wind knocks me down and im falling. Luckily i was able to hold myself at the railing of the 8th floor when this this lunatic comes and hits me on the fingers with his shoes. So i fall again and get saved by the trees. Just as im starting to thank got something hits and im here.''\n\nPetrus laughs again and also the second guy can come in.\n\nThan the third one starts: ,, I just hid in the fridge when....\n\n (Sry for bad english)",

Unfortunately because of the aforementioned event I really needed to poo. The toilets were at the other end of the campus and I was alone because the teacher taking the after school supervision went to get his books. I obviously didn’t just want to lay a pile on the floor so I was desperately holding it in because the teacher had told me to stay there while he fixed the projector across the campus. It was then that I saw the fire extinguisher. I took the top off of it because it was special European type that you can just take the top off and has a really large hole. So I shat in the hole. All the while considering if this would count in my shit-in-the-urinal count. After I was done the teacher got back into the classroom about 5 minutes later. He didn’t suspect a thing.\nFast forward two days. Me and my class (there are 753 people in my class) were in the science lab (where I had done the deed) and we were experimenting with Bunsen burners and the effects of fire on spinning rotors and going through safety regulations. When the teacher said “don’t worry I can put out the fire with this fire extinguisher if anything happens” I knew something bad would happen\nI asked to go to the toilet because I knew something would go wrong. When I got back the science lab had burned down and none of my classmates were to be found. \nAt that moment I knew shit had hit the fan.",

When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Miami Dolphins whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.\nThe Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout \"Cah\", not a single one could shout \"bike\"",

He opens the door and the security guards shove the actor in. The drive is very long and the actor has no idea where he is going. He needs the job, so he keeps his mouth shut. 4 hours later, the Limo stops and the driver opens the door. The actor gets out and sees that he is on the coast. A helicopter is on a landing platform, its blades spinning wildly. The helicopter pilot rushes across the platform and yells over the sound of the blades, \"What's the line?\"\n\n\"Hark, for yonder art thou cannon!\" the actor yells back.\n\n\"Good,\" the pilot smiles at him. He grabs the actor by the arm and leads him to the helicopter. They fly across the entire ocean, but the actor still does not ask where they are going. Land comes into view and, soon, they are landing on top of an Opera House. The pilot lets the actor out and takes off a moment later. A man in a fine suit approaches the actor and asks him, \"What's your line?\"\n\n\"Ummm....Hark, for yonder art thou cannon!\" the actor responds. \n\n\"Exquisite,\" the man smiles. He grabs the actor and they begin to run. They enter a staircase from the top of the Opera House and begin their descent. Soon, the actor begins to hear the sounds of Opera. The night is already in full swing. The two men burst from the stairwell and the actor sees that they are backstage. Dozens of stagehands appear and begin to strip the actor of his clothes and dress him in a fancy costume. \n\nA woman approaches the actor, who has now been fully dressed. \"What's your line?\" she asks with a French accent. \n\n\"People keep asking me that,\" the actor scoffs. \"But it's 'Hark, for yonder art thou cannon.'\"\n\nThe woman grins and leads him towards the stage. The Opera is in its final act. Suddenly, the woman shoves the actor in the back and he stumbles out onto the stage, where thousands of eyes become fixed upon him. The room goes quiet. The thundering sound of a cannon breaks the silence, causing the actor to jump in surprise.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT???\" he screams.",

One night Freddie's house catches on fire and Freddie is engulfed in the flames. \n\nThe next day a police officer finds James and Thomas at the local pub. After explaining the incident the officer asks the two men to come to the mortuary to identify the body. At the mortuary the officer says that he will take them in one by one. \n\nOfficer: \"Look, we found the body in Freddie's bed so we are pretty sure it is him. We just need you to confirm it. We will be in and out as quick as possible.\"\n\nJames agrees to go first, enters the room and the police officer uncovers the body. \n\nJames: \"oh, he's very badly burnt. I'm not sure I can confirm if that is freddie. Could you turn him over please?\"\n\nThe officer agrees and turns over the body. \n\nJames: \"No, I'm sorry but that's not Freddie.\"\n\nThe officer is a bit perplexed by this but takes the man at his word none the less. \n\nOfficer: \"Okay James, thanks for your assistance. Can you send in Thomas in on the way out?\"\n\nThomas enters the room and the officer once again uncovers the body.\n\nThomas: \"oh, he's very badly burnt. I'm not sure I can confirm if that is freddie. Could you turn him over?\"\n\nThe officer agrees once again and turns over the body. \n\nThomas: \"No, I'm sorry but that's not Freddie.\"\n\nJust as Thomas is about to leave the officer asks:\n\"Hang on a minute. You said exactly the same as James as soon as I turned the body over. How can you be so sure it isn't Freddie?\"\n\nThomas: \"Well officer, whenever we were walking around in town, people always used to say - oh look, theres Freddie with the two arseholes.\"",

This was temporary as he was having problems in school and his mother hoped his grandmother would be more luck. So he attends the first day of school with no problem but he decides to stay after everyone leaves for a project, then afterwards he is walking home from school and he sees the highschool and a lone car in the middle of the football field. Curious, he goes up to the car where he sees a guy and a girl having sex. The guy was thrusting so hard his condom literally popped off and landed in the field. Without hesitation the little boy picks up the condom and continues to watch. The guy notices the condom is missing and sees the obviously retarded little boy holding it with a huge grin on his face. He says to the little boy \"Hey, Gimme that damn thing back!\" The little boy replies \"No, its my twinkie\" The man again persists \"Give it back now or i'll kick your ass!\" The little boy replies \"But no, its my twinkie\" Seeing the boy was obviously retarded he couldn't bring himself to beat him up so he finally says \"Look kid, if you give it back i'll give you 20 dollars OK?\" quickly the boy agrees and runs home as fast as he could. He flings open the door and his grandmother quickly greets him He was so excited about the previous event he Yelled at the top of his lungs, \"Grandma Grandma some guy gave me 20 dollars for a twinkie, even though I sucked all the creme filling out!\"",

He was furious, as he knew he had the right of way.  He was about to let loose a barrage of four letter words at the other driver, when a gorgeous creature stepped out of the Toyota and, with the sweetest of smiles, accepted full responsibility and apologized profusely.  The moved their cars into the parking lot of a nearby gas station as to not cause a traffic jam and continued to chat.  Billy was captivated by the charm of this beautiful woman.  After exchanging first names she suggested that they celebrate their newfound friendship with a drop of the best.  She produced a bottle of Grand Marnier and two glasses which she filled to the brim and toasted: \"To us-bottoms up.\"  Billy was happy to oblige, but was perplexed to see that she poured her own drink onto the ground.  Billy, somewhat puzzled, asked her: \"Aren't you going to drink?\"  \"Not until the police have been here,\" she replied, removing the bottle and glasses.",

Three, drink a fifth of this Yukon whiskey.”\nThe man slid over a jug of the strongest Yukon whiskey in the world. Bill chugged down his fifth and stumbled out the door.

After he finishes the man takes his hoodie and fake beard away and says:\n\n-Haha, I'm the man from the bus.\n\nSo the nun takes away her scarf and says:\n\n-Haha, I'm the busdriver.",

I told her no, it was because I'd been sitting in the road licking my balls and a car hit me. \n\nI thought one guy was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard as he staggered out the door. \n\nStupid cow..........why else would I buy dog food?",

    "selftext": "First thing Monday morning, he sets off on his first round and soon catches up to the person in front. He sees that this is a woman and, as he catches up to her on a par 3, that, in fact, she's very attractive. He's interested and suggests that they play the rest of the round together. She agrees and a very close match ensues. She turns out also to be a very talented golfer and she wins their little competition on the last hole. He congratulates her in the parking lot then offers to give her a lift when he sees she doesn't have a car. All in all it's been a highly enjoyable morning. \n\nOn the way to her place, she thanks him for the morning's company and competition and says she hasn't enjoyed herself so much on the course for a long time. \"In fact,\" she says, \"I'd like you to pull over so I can show you how much I appreciated everything.\" He pulls over, they kiss and she gives him the best oral sex he's ever had. \n\nThe next morning he spies her at the first tee and suggests they play together again. He's actually quite competitive and slightly peeved that she beat him the previous day. Again they have a magnificent day, enjoying each other's company and playing a tight, competitive round of golf. Again she pips him at the last, again he drives her home and again she shows her appreciation. \n\nThis goes on all week, with her beating him narrowly every day. This is a sore point for his male ego but, nevertheless, in the car home from their Friday afternoon round, he tells her that he has had such a fine week that he has a surprise planned: dinner for two at a fancy candle-lit restaurant followed by a night of passion in the penthouse apartment of a posh hotel. Surprisingly, she bursts into tears and says she can't agree to this. \n\nHe can't work out what the fuss is about but eventually she admits the reason. \"You see,\" she tearfully sobs, \"I'm a transvestite.\" He is aghast. He swerves violently off the road, pulls the car to a screeching halt and curses madly, overcome with emotion. \"I'm sorry,\" she repeats. \"You bastard,\" he screams, red in the face, \"You cheating bastard. You've been playing off the women's tees all week!!\"",

What’s up?” because everybody knows Johnny.\n\n\"Well, my teacher sent me to the principal, the principal sent me to the superintendent, the superintendent sent me to the mayor, the mayor sent me to the governor, the governor sent me to the senator, the senator sent me to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State sent me to the Vice President, and the Vice President sent me to the President, and the President sent me out of the country because I don't like peanut butter,\" Johnny said.\n\n\"What!\" Exclaimed the pilot, \"that is not okay. You need to get off of my plane.”\n\nSo the pilot gave Johnny a parachute and made him jump out of the plane, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and as he was getting close to the ocean, Johnny released the parachute. He fell some more, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, and he fell, until eventually he landed in the ocean. \n\nKnowing that his only chance of survival was to get to land, Johnny detached the parachute and looked around to see if there was any land nearby. Luckily, he saw a beach on the horizon and started to swim towards it. He swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam, and he swam for what felt like hours until eventually he got to the land.\n\nUpon getting out of the water, he saw that there was a road going along the beach with a sign on the other side that said “Peanut butter free zone.” Finally, Johnny would be free of the condiment that had ruined his life! In his excitement, Johnny ran across the road and got hit by a truck and died. \n\nThe moral of this story is: always look both ways before you cross the street.",

I can also use it to catch fish in the retention pond out back. These are the times we must be tough so we can persevere and see this thing through.

He was a scary looking motherfucker, tattooed and scarred. \"Hey - welcome to your new home,\" he said softly, \"we'll get on just fine.\"\n\nOur new inmate was suprised that his cellmate wasn't as mean or bad as he looked, so set about trying to make the most of his new life, stowing his meagre possessions and getting used to the din of all the men and trying to make his bunk comfortable. \n\nDuring the day, they talked and got to know one another. Both seemed to make friends with each other so easily. The giant was so helpful, giving advice about how to adapt to life in porridge. This seemed like a fairly good situation in a bad place. \n\nFinally, night came and so did lockdown. Lights out and quietness fell heavily on the wing. \n\nThe big fella hoarsely whispered, \"We get lonely without women in here. Sometimes we fool around, you know? It's just one of those things. Nothing to it. Just relief. You feel me?\"\n\nTerror fell on our hero. His heart was pounding, he was sweating. He had noticed the trouser snake his cellmate was packing. His arse clenched, his balls ascended heavens high and his willy looked like a second belly button. Fear possessed his entire being. There was no way out - the cell was locked and no one to turn to for protection. \n\nThe giant guy whispered, \"This is going to happen, one way or another. You're new, so I'll take it easy on you. I'll make you a deal. You wanna be daddy or mommy?\"\n\nRelief flowed throughout the newly incarcerated man's body and mind. He wasn't going to suffer that worst of indignities after all. He managed to stutter, \"I'll be daddy, thanks\", wiping the sweat from his brow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then get over here and suck mommy's cock!\"",

We can't use you \"\n\nRight next door was a Navy recruiter who told me \"Son your ears are too fucked up. Sorry son we can't use you. You'd lose your balance and fall overboard \"\n\nOne floors up was the Air Force I knew that my hearing wouldn't be an issue because of the noise of the aircraft. The recruiter said \"Son, your vision isn't good enough, we can't use you.\"\n\nTwo doors down was the Marine Corp office. The absolutely wanted me. They told me they were not worried about my hearing Marine Corp DIs yell loud enough to wake the dead.  They were not worried about me falling overboard they fly me wherever they wanted me. They were not worried about my vision they could give me glasses. They wanted to interview my parents.\n\nA week later I got a letter of rejection. Unfit for military service from the Marines. Those bastards turned me down because my parents were married.  I stormed off to the recruiting office to inform them that I was adopted. And that son of a bitch lance corporal  told me that it didn't matter. My mom was way to polite even for a Southerner.",

As it happens, there was this school shooting incident last week; I was first on site, I shot the gunman, and the Congress wants to hear exactly what happened”\n\nNurse: ”Me too! I was first responder as a paramedical nurse, and they asked me to tell my story, so they can understand the scale of human tragedy.”\n\nMan in suit: ” I’m going there too, I’m a lawyer”\n\nNurse: ”Wow, are they finally planning to change the gun laws now, or what?”\n\nLawyer: ” Yes. So my employer, NRA sent me, and I took my friends professor Keller and Father Joseph along. Because this is not a time to discuss gun control, this is a time for thoughts and prayers.",

They badly need some way to destroy these enemy ships. The general summons a lieutenant.\n\n“What sort of resources do we have available?”\n\n“Only a few Hellcats sir” is the reply\n\n“Wonderful, assign them to D-company, and tell them to attack those ships” commands the general.\n\n“D-company?

Are you sure?” the lieutenant stammers out.\n\n“Of course I’m sure, that’s an order lieutenant”\n\nSeeing no opportunity for further argument, the lieutenant carries out his orders and gives D-company the Hellcats. Then, he watches on in amazement as the tanks climb up the sides of the enemy warships and quickly earn a decisive victory. He asks the general, “Sir, I don’t understand. How did that happen? And why on earth did you give this job to D-company? \n\nThe general gives a quick puff on his cigar and says, “Why lieutenant, it’s the simplest thing.

Can I give it to him instead? I can have him ask if I'm coming off disrespectfully.\"\n\n\"Don't wanna meet yo daddy. Just want you in my caddy. Eep-kay it.\"\n\nLucy softly rejects the offer. \"I couldn't just take it, my Mother is right there, she can ask for it in his behalf.\"\n\n\"Don't wanna meet yo mamma. I just want you to come-a. Ake-tay it, please.\"\n\n\"Okay. Well thank you.\" Lucy peruses it, and realized it is too short to warm a dwarf.\n\nAs she is puzzlling over it, Andre steps in, \"Oh! I forgot, you ave-hay to loosen it by shaking it back and forth.\" Lucy daintily shakes the caddy to no avail. \"Shake it,\" exclaims Andre. Lucy shakes a little harder. \"Shake it! Shake it!\" She begins to shake it even harder. \"Shake it like a Polaroid picture!!!\"\n\nShe flails violently until the caddy stretches out to a proper length. However, in her wild flailing she sligs loose a small pebble that pelts Andre right on the temple.\n\nStill half speaking Pig-latin, Andre screams \"Heeeeey-ahhhhhh!\"",

Despite their rocky relationship, the surgeon pulls on a pair of gloves and prepares to do his part to save his life.\n\nAfter an hour of operating, the surgeon walks out of the operating room to talk to his girlfriend:\n\n‘Great news! The operation was successful, and your father is in a much more stable condition! As I was walking out, he was already strong enough to tell me that he is grateful for my help, and approves of our marriage!’\n\nMonths pass, and the father has changed completely. He displays his newfound love for his new son-in-law, showering him with gifts and attention, and loves to refer to him as son. The surgeons now-wife asks her new husband:\n\n\n\n‘My dad’s completely changed his attitude towards you! How did you do it?’\n\n‘What can I say? I guess I know my way around people’s hearts.’\n\nEdit: A word",

Are you Jesus?\" \n\n\"Yes\" replies the man\n\nThe Irishman, knowing his friends would want proof, asks the man to prove that he is Jesus. \n\nThe man orders a water, and turns it into wine. \n\n\"Aye, but that could be a trick\" the Irishman says. \n\nThe man then shows the Irishman the holes in his hands and feet. \n\n\"Aye, but they could be piercings\" says the Irishman. \n\nGrowing tired of the skepticism, the man takes the Irishman by the hand. The Irishman winces at this as his hands had been riddled with arthritis for years. The man holds his hand, and the arthritis disappears. \n\nThe Irishman goes back over to his table.\n\n\"Lads, lads. That's deffinetly Jesus. He turned water to wine, has holes in his hands and feet and cured my arthritis\" \n\nThe Scotsman, seeing the Irishman's hands, felt he had to see for himself. He goes up to Jesus and asks him to prove it. Jesus, again, turns water to wine and shows the holes in his hands and feet. The Scotsman then says. \n\n\"Jesus, I've been a plasterer for 25 years and my back and shoulders give me a lot of trouble. Can you do anything about that?\"\n\nJesus holds the Scotsman's hand and rids him of his pain. \n\nThe Scotsman goes back to the table. \n\n\"That's Jesus, alright. He turned water to wine, showed me the holes in his hands and feet and took away my muscle pain!\"\n\nThe Englishman thinks he's being had on. There's no way Jesus is at the bar. So, he walks up to the man. \n\n\"I heard you were Jesus\"\n\n\"That, I am.\" Replies Jesus\n\n\"Prove it\" the Englishman retorts. \n\nJesus then repeats the process that he had gone through with the other two. He turns water to wine, shows him the holes in his hands and feet and then reaches out to grab the Englishman's hand. \n\nThe Englishman then yells at Jesus. \n\n\"The fuck are you doing?

The kids loved it, and friends came for the quiet and fishing.\n\nThe engineer, however, wanted something unique for his cabin. He had been an award-winning pole vaulter in college. He therefore built a set of poles with a crosspiece, and a mulched run. He bought a new carbon fiber vaulting pole, new shoes, and was set.\n\nHe would set off down the run, plant his pole, soar over the crosspiece, and land in the river with a satisfying splash. What a great way to spend a hot afternoon. He tried to teach a few friends to vault, with no success.\n\nHe enjoyed his cabin for years, and went out early in the spring one year. It had been a very wet winter, lots of rain afterward. When the family arrived, the river was up and flowing at a good clip, with twice the usual current flowing.\n\nThe engineer was determined to enjoy a few vaults into the water, although his wife didn't think it was safe. But he was a good swimmer and proceeded to have a go at it.\n\nHis run and jump were flawless, he hit the water in good form, but upon surfacing, he was swept downstream and disappeared. His body was found later that day, tangled in streamside debris.\n\nIt was a sad end for the engineer and the family sold the cabin, with no desire to return to the scene of such tragedy.\n\nOur lamented engineer was a civil engineer. Had he consulted one of his electrical engineer brethren, he would have been warned that \"It's not vaultage that kills you, it's the current!\"",

    "selftext": "They’re walking up a hill, talking about what had happened during their childhood. About halfway through the height, the man spots a purple flower out of the corner of his eye. He goes over to it and picks it up. He turns to his friend and says, \n“Hey, look!  A purple flower!”\n\nHis friends face starts to turn white.\n“Dude, what’s wrong?”\n\nHis friend starts screaming and running down the hill. He starts to scream,\n“DON’T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN!”\n\nThe man is very confused. He decides that he might as well not run after him, so he starts to walk down the hill.\n\nOnce he got to the bottom of the hill, he went to the small shop for hunting gear near the forest. The shopkeeper is an old friend of the mans father. He walks into the store and the shopkeeper says,\n“Boy, you look off. What’s wrong?”\n\nHe replied, “I’m not sure what just happened. I was on a hike and my friend just ran off!”\n\nThe shopkeeper asked “What made him do that?”\n\nThe man started, “Well, I picked up this purple flower-“\n\nThe shopkeeper cut him off. “A purple flower!? Do you have it with you?”\n\nThe man said “Yes.” and pulled out the flower. \nThe shopkeeper started screaming. “GET OUT OF MY STORE!” he yelled. He pulled one of the rifles from the wall and started to load it. The man immediately ran out of the store and down the dirt road.\n\nHe made it to the suburbs of his town. He thought, “Wow, today has been crazy. I can’t wait to tell my girlfriend this.”\n\nHe called a cab and started down the road. The driver made conversation.\n“Hey, how ya doin?”\n\n“Oh, not great.”\n\n“Huh? Why’s that?”\n\n“It’s a very weird story. I was hiking with my friend when I found a purple flower. He ran away from me, then-“\n\nThe cab driver cut him off. “A purple flower?”\n\nThe man pulled out the flower and said, “Yes, this flower right here.”\n\nThe driver slammed on the breaks and screamed, “GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CAR!”\nHe was pushed out of the car. \n\nHe started the walk to his girlfriends house. Once he finally got there, he opened the door to his girlfriend preparing dinner. He decided it would be best not to mention the flower until after he had dinner.\n\nThey sat down and begin to ate. His girlfriend asked, “Did anything interesting happen today?”\n\nTo which the man couldn’t help but reply, “I was hiking with my friend today when I found this purple flower,  and then he started-“\n\nUnsurprisingly, his girlfriend cut him off. “Purple flower!?”\n\n“Yes,” the man said. He was bracing for the screaming, and then it hit.\n\n“GET OUT! GET OUT NOW! WE NEVER DATED! WE NEVER EVEN MET!”\n\nHe walked out the door as it was slammed behind him. \n\nConfused, he went to his parents house for guidance. He knocked on the door and they opened it, happy to see their son. They watched TV and talked for a bit before the flower cake up.\n“Mom? Dad?” he said.\n\n“What is it?” his mother replied.\n\n“Today, I found a purple flower on a hike, and everyone’s been screaming about it the whole day!”\n\n“That’s horrible,” his father said. “Do you have it with you? I want to see it.”\n\nRelieved, the man pulled out the flower. His mother took the pillow next to her and put it over her face. His dads face turned beet red. He \nscreamed,\n “GET OUT OF OUR HOUSE! YOU’RE NOT MY SON! I NEVER HAD YOU!”\n\nHe ran out of the house, sobbing. It was now getting dark and he was soaked from the rain. He sat down at a bus station next to an old woman. The old woman looked at him and said, \n\n“You look distressed. What’s wrong?”\n\nHe explained. \n“Well, today I was on a hike with my best friend when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a purple flower. I picked it up and he started running and screaming. I was confused and then went to the hunting shop near the mountain. I walked in and showed him the flower and he sent me out of the store! Then I got a taxi to go to my girlfriends house, but when I told him about the purple flower, he threw me out. Then, once I got to my girlfriends house, I told her, and then she said that she hated me and never even knew me! Then, I went to my parents and asked them about it, and they threw me out too! I don’t know what’s going on.”\n\nThe woman nodded. “You know, there’s a library across the street. You could probably find something about it there.”\n\nThe man lit up. “Thank you so much!” he said. He started running across the street and then he got hit by a bus and died.\n\nMoral of the story: Look both ways before crossing the road.",

    "selftext": "Once, there was a married couple who was about to have a son. When their son finally was born, they named him Cythera, after the Greek island with the same name, where the couple had gone for their honeymoon. \n\nTheir son grew up to be a nice and well-mannered young man, and was just about to start seeking for a job when he got a letter from a distant relative, who lived in Mexico. The letter read as follows:\n\n*Dear Cythera.*\n\n*I am your great great-grandfathers granddaughter, and I need you to move to Mexico*\n\n*You see, I run a family business that have been passed on for several generations. Just recently, my grandson died fighting a wild bull, and I have no close relatives to pass the business on. You were the closest one I was able to track down, and I must therefore ask you to move here and inherit the business.* \n\n*My time on this earth is soon over, so I need you to come as soon as possible.*\n\n*Sincerely, María*\n\nCythera was baffled over getting this possibility, but he didn't plan on letting it slip by, and already the next day was he on a flight to Mexico. At his arrival he was greeted by some friends of the family. They had somehow misheard Cythera for Cito, and him being rather socially awkward, decided not to correct them. It didn't take long before everyone called him Cito, so Cythera decided it would be easier just to change his name to it. \n\nThe family business turned out to be a spa. It was tradition to rename the spa after the owner, and the spa was currently called Spa María or just María as the locals called it. María was still in charge, but it was clear that she didn't have much time left. When she ultimately died, it was Cito who was the new owner. He felt very unprepared, but after a week, he was finally ready to open it to the public. A little crowd had gathered to witness the grand reopening. The spa came under new leadership that day. It was no longer the Spa María people were familiar with, no, now it was the Spa Cito.",

Yeah OK\" so the businessman cuts him a check right there, and takes the mouse and leaves.\n\nThe barkeep says to the man \"Are you crazy!?\" A mouse like that has got to be worth 10x that much! What were you thinking?\"\n\nThe man calmly sips his drink and replies with a wry smile \"The jokes on him, the frog is a ventriloquist.\"",

Any element rare on Earth is as common as carbon(C) here, and interestingly carbon(C) doesn't occur naturally here. So we had to make good of what we had, the buildings are made of rare metals like radium(Ra) which glow in the dark.\"\n\nAfter half an hour they arrived at what seemed the main highway, the road had a faint bluish glow and the sides were lined with metallic posts shining faintly in the double moonlight. They stopped near a small dilapidated shack with the words \"COMMUNICATION OFFICE\" crudely etched on the walls. \n\n\"This is your office. You are supposed to handle communications for the colony,\" the driver said. \"We can't use any wireless communication as the high amount of radioactive gases in the atmosphere interferes with the signal, so we have to use a type of telegraph instead. Come on, I'll show you our most important resource.\"\n\nThey walked a bit till they reached a plantation full of bizarre trees. Some were made of precious metals, some of common earth metals and some of them were glowing radioactively.\n\n\"This is the plantation for building the posts. We brought these seeds from Earth and planted them, apparently as they couldn't get the conventional elements they just used what the soil contained. We just sell the gold(Au), silver(Ag) and platinum(Pt) trees to Earth, the iron(Fe) and aluminium(Al) are used for constructing equipment and there are some pretty rare elements like uranium(U) and astatine(At) (which is the rarest element on Earth) which are used for scientific research. However, these aren't what we are here for.\" \n\nThe driver motioned him to follow him towards a small area of trees with a silvery sheen to them.\n\n\"These are made of rhenium(Re) one of the densest elements with one of the highest melting and boiling points. It is strong enough to withstand the toxic atmosphere and radioactivity of this planet. So we use it to make the telegraph posts. As you may have noticed we have lined almost the whole road with telegraph lines.\"\n\n\"You don't mean...\", the recruit began.\n\n\"Yes,\" the driver cut him off,\"this place is full of (Re)posts.\"",

He decides to ask around.\n\n\nThe first person he meets is a wealthy man. \"That's easy,\" he says. \"The meaning of life is to accumulate wealth. Then you can transform and inspire your community.\" The young man takes this advice to heart. He studies hard, gets into a prestigious school and becomes a stock broker. He has an inherent gift for the work and wealth comes easily. Before long, he is living in the lap of luxury. Of course he remembers to do good work in his community as well, but try as he might, there is only so much he can change. He still feels like something is missing. Now a middle aged man, he decides to ask someone else about the meaning of life.\n\n\nThe next person he asks is a hedonist. \"That's easy,\" he says. \"Life is rich in all kinds of personal pleasures. Sample each one, indulge all your senses!\" The middle aged man takes this advice to heart. Using his vast fortune, he is able to travel the world. He eats the rarest delicacies, makes love to the most beautiful women. He tries all manner of exotic substances in order to expand his mind. But soon enough, his fortune is gone, and despite the many unique experiences he has had, he still finds something missing. \n\n\nNow an old man, he decides to ask one more time. The next person he meets is a preacher, who says, \"that's easy. Dedicate the remainder of your life to communion with God.\" So the old man joins a church and repents his sins. His days are spent in prayer and meditation. However, he is bothered by the many differences in the religions of the world. The way they all claim to be right strikes him as arrogant and overbearing, and sure enough, he still feels like something is missing inside him.\n\nOne day he takes a long walk on the beach and spots a monk going through some sort of martial arts exercise. His kicks and punches flow like water and the expression of peace on his face is sublime. So once again, he gathers his courage and asks; \"Excuse me, sir, do you know the meaning of life?\"\n\n\n\"That's easy,\" says the monk. \"You must first master and then let go of the self. On the highest mountain in Tibet there is a monastery. There you will find the wisest men on Earth, who have spent many decades devoted to this path. Go learn from them.\"\n\n\nAs always, the old man takes this advice to heart. He sells what's left of his things, buys some mountain climbing supplies, and ascends the mountain. He is exhausted but there is indeed a beautiful temple before him! When he walks through the door, there are masters in flowing robes sitting on the floor, each with a line of disciples before them. Each master is teaching a complex martial art technique meant not only to help combat a strong opponent, but to strengthen one's own body and mind.\n\n\nThe old man gets in the first line, but they are teaching a throw which would be too hard on his back.\n\n\nThe old man gets in the second line, but they are teaching a spinning kick. He lacks the dexterity for this.\n\n\nThe old man gets in the third line, but they are teaching a precise counterattack, and his reflexes have dulled with age.\n\n\nSoon enough he realizes that he must start with the most basic training these sages can offer, so he tracks down a disciple that doesn't look particularly busy and says; \"excuse me, sir? I came here looking for the meaning of life but I am terribly lost. I need an easy technique to get me started. Could you please help me find the punch line?\"",

The whole place erupted with laughter.\n\n\"Hey, you lost a shoe!\"\n'Nah, mate. I found one.'\n\"Where is your gun? You're not gonna catch anything with that stick!\"\n'It's not a stick, it's a boomerang!\"\n\"Either way you ain't catching any grizzlies today with that.\"\n\nNigel got  quite cranky at this and shouted \"I'll show you!\" And sprinted off full speed into the trees. \n\nThe Americans decided rather than trying to follow him blindly they would go into the cabin and have a few drinks and wait for him to cool down and come back. A few hours go past and they decide he is either lost or dead so decide to go look for him. As they get up and start to get ready they hear a voice outside.\n\n\"OPEN DA FUCKING DOOR, OPEN DA FUCKING DOOR!\"\n\nThey look out the window and Nigel is running towards the cabin, behind him is a big grizzly bear chasing him with a big bump on his head.  They run to the door and open it, Nigel jumps to the side at the last minute and the bear runs into the cabin. Nigel closes the door behind the bear and shouts through the closed door \n\n\"Alright, you skin dis one, I'll go get anudda one.\"\n\nCredit: Kevin 'Bloody' Wilson",

He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. \n\nHe was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could survive until midnight he would be okay. \n\nHe felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.\n\nWhen he got home his wife said, \"I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?\"\n\nHe said, \"I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.\"\n\nShe said, \"You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!\"",

    "selftext": "\n\nHe loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.\n \nWell, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.\n \nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.\n \n\"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said, \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\"",

It seems you are mistaken.“ He looks to the worms that he brought in a box. “I'm only taking my pet worms for a swim, and since i don't wanna lose 'em I bind 'em to the rod.“ The policeman looks at the worms, closely, then back to the fischer. “Indeed, it seems that I'm mistaken. I must beg your pardon. Non the less I still have to ask for a fine of 50$“ The fisher looks shocked. “Why is that!?“ “Well it also seems your worms aren't wearing any swimming suits“",

There was this really dumb farmer that was tending to his cows. So, he let them to pasture and they ended up finding a patch of marijuana, right? So they ate it all because the resin was sweet, and the ended up getting REALLY stoned, just completely wasted. Remember, this is the middle ages so we didn't really understand anything medically. So the farmer walks out to check on his cows and sees them all tumbling around and acting foolish and he panics. So he goes and grabs his pitchfork and walks back and starts stabbing the fuck out of them. Just kills each and every one of them. When his wife saw, she runs out and says \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" And he turns and says....\n\n  \n\"I had to....The Steaks were too High.\"",

He met the second man, who looked quite astonished. \"You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.\" \"No, I'll prove it again,\" says the first man as he jumps.

Slim, attractive, the lot. \"Love me hard and long or climb the ladder to success\" she flirted.   \nUnable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again.

After looking at the car he decided to flag down another car for a tow to the nearest town.\n\nAfter waiting for several hours along came a man driving a ferrari, who saw the old man on the side of the road and decided to pull over and help. The old ask \"Would it be possible for you to give me a tow to the nearest town?\", rather in a kinda mood the driver said \"Yep, no problem... I'll just tow you with a rope and if I am going to fast toot your horn\".\n\nSo happily along the road they went... Then 15mins latter a porsche flys past both the car passing them at twice the speed limit. The man in the ferrari thinks to himself, \"I'm not going to let a porsche overtake me\" and speeds up to catch him.\n\nWhilst this is all happening, a police man is happily eating his lunch up ahead on the side of the road. Next thing all these cars fly past and make him drop his lunch in shock, so he picks up the mic and says \"Boss Boss, Your not going to believe what I just saw... I saw a porsche being chased by a ferrari.... then there was an old man in an old car beeping his horn to pass them both...\"",

    "selftext": "In World War I there was trench warfare, and neither the Americans nor the Germans could get the upper hand. They were reaching a stalemate. One day, an American came up with a plan that would win them the war. This private explained his plan to his trench mates, and they figured, \"Why not? It's not like we have any better ideas.\" The next day, an American soldier called out, \"Hans!?\" A German popped up and shouted back, \"Ja?!\" Boom, the German was shot dead. The next day the Americans shouted again, \"Hans?!\" \"Ja?!\" Shot dead. This process continued over the next couple of days. The Germans were losing large numbers and were now finally catching on.\n\nThe Germans had an emergency meeting. They thought they could come back from the heavy losses using the same tactics as the Americans. Thus, a German asked, \"What is a popular American name?\" \"John!\" replied another. The next day, the Germans decided to execute their plan. A German shouted, \"John!?\" An American called back, \"Is that you Hans?!\" \"Ja!\" And that is how the Americans won WWI.",

And one day, they’re sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer’s kid is watching MTV, and they’re watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says “you know what? I’m gonna learn how to do that.”  \n  \nSo the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, “Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.”  \n  \nGuy on the phone says “no problem. Come on down.”  \n  \n“No, there might be one problem. I’m a horse.”  \n  \n“Naw, it ain’t a problem. We’ll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.”  \n  \nSo horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he’s like “LOOK WHAT I CAN DO” and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says “holy shit. That’s awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What’s like that?” And horse says “Bass. Learn to play bass.”  \n  \nSo Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says “Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.”  \n  \nGuy on the phone says “No problem, miss, come on down.”  \n  \n“Eh, this might be a problem. I’m a cow.”  \n  \n“Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.”  \n  \nSo Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says “Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.”  \n  \nHorse says “Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.”  \n  \nSo Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says “Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.”  \n  \nGuy on the phone says “No problem, man. Come on down.”  \n  \n“Eh, maybe a problem. I’m a chicken.”  \n  \n“Naw. Ain’t no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.”  \n  \nSo chicken learns the drums, and he’s fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer’s out. And one day they’re playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he’s like “what the fuck? that sounds amazing.” so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says “Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You’re gonna be HUGE.”  \n  \nSo Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy’s deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they’re big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there’s a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom’s real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they’re cool as hell. They say “Listen. Go see your mom. We’ll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.”  \n  \nHorse says “Thanks, guys. you’re the best,” and he takes off.  \n  \nCouple of days later, Horse’s mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It’s his agent. Cow and Chicken’s plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he’s lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He’s been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he’s on that walk, he just can’t shake the blue, so he figures to himself “Alright, alright.

He thinks to himself, \"I am fast as a speeding bullet, I can fly in, pump a few times, and be gone before Wonder Woman even knows what happened\".\n\nSo as fast as a speeding bullet Superman swoops in, pumps a few times, and speeds away when finished. Wonder Woman looks up at the invisible Man and says \"what the fuck was that?\", Invisible Man responds \"I dunno but my ass hole sure hurts\".\n\nFirst time I heard this was in movie Hollow Man. I've posted before and I'm sure others have as well but this is still my go to joke to tell. Lol",

He looks at the outside of the car, and its small, look inside and there is a king sized bed.\n\n'Huh?' thinks Mel\n\nJust then the light turns green and Ronnie says \"Ok, see ya\" and drives off.\n\nAnd this drives Mel just about crazy. He starts telling all his friends and family about the king sized bed in the back of Ronnie’s car and they all think he has gone mad. \nSo Mel starts calling auto shops and asking if they could put a king sized bed into the back of his jag, and they all just laugh at him and hang up on him. But Mel soldiers on, he starts calling auto shops further and further away until finally he calls \"Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing\" shop in Watsonville California.\n\n\"Hello\" Says the guy answering the phone, \"Uncle Bobs Garage and fine Detailing, Dave speaking, what I can do for you?\" \n\n\"Hi\" Says Mel, \"This is going to sound odd, but can you put a bed into the back of my Jag?\"\n\n\"You bet” Says Dave \"Bring it in on Tuesday and we'll get that in there for you\"\n\nFinally! Mel is delighted and he immediately drives from Toronto Ontario to Watsonville California, (about 40 hours of driving I might add) gets the work done, pays the guy, and drives home as happy as a clam.\n\nMonths go by. And finally, Mel gets his chance. He is driving along and he sees Ronnie’s 2003 Toyota parked by the side of the road. Mel stops his car jumps out and goes over to Ronnie’s, But, the windows are a little steamed up, there is a gentle rocking motion of the car, and Mel is a little concerned with should he disturb him or not. So Mel waits a couple of minutes until he can't stand it anymore and taps the window. Nothing happens. He taps it again only a little louder. A few seconds go by and then Ronnie rolls down the window, a little bit of steam escapes from the car, and there is Ronnie wearing nothing but a bath towel. \n\n\"Hey Ronnie!\" Says Mel “Guess what? I got a bed in the back of my car! Just like you, come on check it out\"\n\n'Oh' Says Ronnie, \"You got me out of my shower just to tell me that?\"",

The bear froze. The forest was silent. As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky: \"You deny my existence for all of these years, teach others I don't exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Why do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?\"\nThe atheist looked directly into the light, \"It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as a believer now, but perhaps could you make the BEAR a believer?\"\n\"Very well,\" said the voice. The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together and bowed his head and spoke:\n\"Lord, bless this food, which I am about to receive from thy bounty , Amen.\"",

The poor thing devoured them in moments. Since she needed a good clean up I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't use because you say they are too tight. I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't use because I don't have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't use just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't use because someone at work has a pair the same.\"\nThe husband took a quick breath and continued - \"She was so grateful for my understanding and help and as I walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, Please ... do you have anything else that your wife doesn't use?\"",

Alas he remembers the wedding ring on his finger and frowns. \"I suppose I'll carry on to success?\"\n\nShe smiles again and with the wave of her hand, the door slides open, revealing a modest but nonetheless quite lovely vestibule. He leaves his suitcase at the lobby, and almost as though in a trance, wanders through.\n\nInside, he sees a table, or more accurately, a polished slab of white marble. Lying atop the marble is another lady, even more attractive than the first, clad more than a little immodestly. She slides over to meet his awestruck gaze and offers him a dazzling smile, her red lips parting to reveal a perfect row of teeth. She looks at him with eyes that seem to flicker between shades of the most exquisite turquoise gems and with a sensual finger, unbuttons a shirt button.\n\nThe traveller musters up a queasy smile and attempts a wave.\n\n\"You can take me, right here right now. You can do whatever you like to me, baby.\" She gestures towards a door at the end of the corridor. \"Or,\" she whispers, \"you can carry on to success.\"\n\nNow trembling uncontrollably, the traveller ignores the visceral scream inside urging him to stay with this goddess, and manages a mumbled apology, avoiding eye contact and somehow making it to the door despite being partially blinded by the cold beads of sweat now streaming down his brow.\n\nInto the next room he goes, and the next, and the next. Each room more palatial, each girl defying all possible expectations of beauty, each girl offering themselves, each girl offering him to carry on to success.\n\nEach time, the traveller promises himself to stop at the next room, but now he is positively broken, spellbound at the possibilities of what may greet him should he continue.\n\n\"Carry on to success,\" he breathes. It has become his mantra. \n\nWith a deep breath, he stumbles through a door and gasps as it slams shut behind him. He surveys his surroundings and cannot help but be perplexed when he sees the yellowing walls, the flickering fluorescent bulb hanging above his head at a lopsided angle.\n\nHis investigation is interrupted by a phlegmy cough and he turns around.\n\nStanding in front of him is a beast of a man, wearing nothing but a greasy cloth, and the rug of hair adorning everywhere but his scalp.\n\nReeling at the stench that permeates his nostrils, he coughs, \"what the fuck is this?\" \n\nThe man puts a finger on the traveller's mouth, and with the other hand, strokes his cheek. \"Shhhh, baby, it's okay, it's okay.\" A toothy grin follows and he pushes the traveller on to the filthy mattress in the centre of the cell. \"I'm Cess.\"",

He dropped his pants and dumped the biggest load he had ever dumped. He went down the stairs, relieved and calmer than he had ever been. The once Crowded motel was now desolately empty.

    "selftext": "Or, rather than walks, floats; for helium, at room temperature, is a gas, and thus has no legs with which to walk, and, due to its lighter-than-air nature, does not sink to the ground. The bartender himself is confused, for not only is helium invisible to the naked eye in the absence of another object to contain it, should quickly dissipate. Furthermore, a cloud of helium, lacking any sort of motor system, is at the mercy of atmospheric currents and cannot enter a bar under its own power. It should not have been capable of opening the door to the bar. Even if it could, hypothetically, propel itself in such a manner, the lack of any semblance of a nervous system would make meaningful coordination difficult, if not impossible. And, if the cloud of helium has no nervous system, how can it think to enter a bar? How can it be self-conscious enough to know that it desires a drink? To question it is to question the nature of the self itself. What is the self? Is the self the physical body? But when the body is wounded, and, say, a limb is lost, the removed tissue is no longer considered part of the self. Is the self the consciousness? Yet nobody denies that an individual is no longer himself when he sleeps. Is the self a spiritual force, invisible and nebulous like the helium which provokes these questions? No scientific, empirical evidence of such exists; it is the domain of scholars, priests, and mortals who chase the shadows of the unknown. Who could say? It is a question that mankind has struggled to solve since the dawn of time without success.\n\nThe bartender is facing an existential crisis when he recalls the bar's policy towards noble gases and his psyche is once again put at ease. \"You're going to have to leave, we don't serve your kind here,\" he says, grunting at the mass of atoms.\n\nThe helium doesn't react.",

But this required absolute obedience to the rules, and commitment to Martin Love's regime. To make sure people knew exactly what they were getting into, you had to memorize all the rules before you were even allowed to sign the contract.\n\nDaniel and Jane had always been good friends of Martin, and so they thought they might get a bit of a discount, or that he wouldn't be quite as strict. But Martin still made all the same requirements and wouldn't give them the option to sign the commitment form until they had memorized the rules. This made them reconsider but they knew they wouldn't be able to get the same level of coaching from anyone else. \n\nAs they were finally about to sign they had a last-minute debate on whether or not to go through with it. Daniel turned to his wife and said:\n\nWe're no strangers to Love\n\nYou know the rules and so do i\n\nA full commitment's what i'm thinking of\n\nYou wouldn't get this from any other guy",

    "title": "at Sumbitch Can Drive",
    "selftext": "  \n\nA woman is driving down the highway alone in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. As she’s driving down the highway she sees a man walking down the side of the road. She thinks to herself what a terrible idea it is to stop for hitch-hikers but given how desolate the area is she decides she cannot simply leave this man out here, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night.\n\nShe slows down and pulls alongside him. She rolls down the passenger side window and asks if he needs a ride.\n\nHe turns toward her revealing that he is holding a cup in his right hand. He looks down, spits in the cup, looks back at her dead in the eyes and says “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”\n\nWell this does not sit well with the woman but she simply cannot stand the thought of leaving the man out here on the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night. So she reaches across her car, throws open the passenger door and tells the man to get in. Which he does.\n\nSo they get to driving down the highway. She starts asking him questions. “Who are you?” “Where you from?” “What are you doing walking down the side of the highway in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night?” \n\nEvery time she asks a question he just looks down at his cup, spits into it, looks back at her dead in the eyes and says “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”\n\nWell finally she is freaked out and within a couple miles sees a sign indicating there is a highway patrol station at the next exit. She exits the highway, turns right and pulls into the highway patrol parking lot.\n\nThe woman runs inside and tells the officer on duty everything that happened. She explains that she knows that she isn’t supposed to pick up hitchhikers but that she just could not stand the thought of leaving this man walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night.\n\nThe officer walks outside, opens the passenger door of the woman’s car and begins asking all the same questions: “Who are you?” “Where are you from?” and “What are you doing walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night?”\n\nEvery time the officer asks a question the man looks down, spits in his cup, looks back up at the officer and answers “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”\n\nFinally the officer has had enough. He pulls the gun out of its holster, cocks the slide chambering a round, flips off the safety, points it directly at the man’s head and says “Look Buddy if you don’t start answering some of my questions I’m going to blow your head all over the interior of this car!”\n\nAnd like that, BOOM that man just snaps out of it! He throws his hands up over his head, looks the officer right in the eyes and pleads for his life “Yes Sir! Anything you want to know I’ll be glad to tell ya! Just please don’t shoot me!”\n\nSo the officer says to him “Well you can start by telling me what you’re doing walking down the side of the highway, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night?!?!?!”\n\nThe man says “Yessir! Absolutely! No Problem! It’s like this: Two days ago I was driving down the highway, minding my own business when my car broke down. So I walked a little ways with my thumb out and after about 30 minutes a trucker stops and told me to hop on in.\n\n“Well we get to cruising down the highway 70, maybe 80 miles an hour and we come up over the crest of this hill and BAM! Right there in front of us is a 20 car pile-up! There is a 50 foot cliff wall to our right and a 100 foot shear dropoff to our left! I looked over at that truck driver and I told that man ‘Mister, if you can get us out of this one, I’ll suck your dick!’” \n\nThe man looked down, spit in his cup, looked back up at the officer and said “at sumbitch can driiiiive.”\n\nNot an edit. Just some reference: In 1999, when I was 19 years old, I signed up for a 5 year enlistment (airwing) in the United States Marine Corps. While in boot camp after lights out one night the guy in the rack next to mine told this joke. His (last) name was Coffelt and everyone within 2-3 racks, top and bottom listened intently. It was all we could do to keep from laughing hard enough to wake our Drill Instructor and have him fuck our lives up immeasurably in the sand pit. This joke being told that night is my fondest memory from my enlistment.",

    "selftext": "Kinda long and terrible (that’s what she said)... \n\n\nSo a man and his wife have a baby boy but the wife doesn’t survive the birth. The man is completely devastated and makes a promise to his late wife to raise their son to the best of his ability and give him everything he could ask for.  \n\nThe man has a good job and is able to provide a wonderful life for his son. \n\nBefore the son’s 4th birthday, the man asked him what he wanted. The son spent a few minutes in thought and finally made a decision. The son wanted green ping pong balls... the man was confused but it also being the anniversary of his wife’s death he decided not to question it. The man searched every store in town and neighboring towns but is unable to find the green ping pong balls. Heartbroken, he decides to get his son the most expensive toy he could find. \n\nOn the son’s birthday, he gives him the expensive toy but apologized as he couldn’t find the green ping pong balls. The son said, “it’s okay dad, I love the present you gave me”. \n\nThe man and son continue to have a great life together and have a very strong bond but every year for the son’s birthday he asks for green ping pong balls but every year it’s the same story. No green ping pong balls but every year, the son is very appreciative of whatever he gets. \n\nWhen the son graduates high school with the highest GPA, the man couldn’t be more proud. He tells his son, “I’m so proud of you I’m gonna buy you whatever you want! Don’t worry about a price tag.” The son again pauses and thinks for a few minutes and then replies “I really want some green ping pong balls”. The man is confused again but decides to search even further out for the green ping pong balls but again finds nothing. He decides to buy his son a new car instead and the son loves it. \n\nThe son eventually graduates from college and becomes a doctor and again the man couldn’t be more proud. The man offers to buy his son anything he wanted without regard to the price but again the son asks for the green ping pong balls. The man searches everywhere but can’t find a single green ping pong ball. Feeling devastated again, he decides to buy his son a mansion, which the son absolutely loves.\n\nOne day, while the man is at work, he receives that dreaded phone call. “Your son was in a car accident, you need to get here now!” \n\nThe man rushes to his son’s death bed, where son thanks his dad for everything he did for him and tells him not to be sad, as he gave him a wonderful life. The man, in tears, says “I have to know something son... all these years, why the green ping pong balls?” \n\nThe son looks at him and says “oh! It’s because...........”",

When people come into the confessional, they keep telling me they've fallen.\" \r\n\r\nThe mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word.

The men talk for a couple of hours and before long the two men have almost drained the whiskey bottle. All the while, the storm has grown worse outside. The talk turns to the terrible weather.\n\n“Look at the rain!” The man says, “it’s almost falling sideways because of the wind!”.\n\n“Look at the wind whipping up the side of the cliff!” The old man replies “the rain is falling upwards! I bet if you were to jump off the cliff and catch the wind in your coat, you would come soaring back up to the bar”\n\nThe man laughs. \n\n“I’m serious, I’m trying it!” Said the old man “put your coat on! Let’s leave the stuff in our pockets here though so we don’t get weighed down. ”\n\nSo the two men go outside and peer over the cliff. It’s a long way down and the bottom of the cliff is littered with jagged rocks. \n“Are you sure you want to try this?” Said the man. \n\n“What have I got to lose?” The old man replied, and without another word he leaped from the cliff, and began hurtling towards his certain death below. \n\nThe man looked away in horror, but when he opened his eyes, the old man was back at the top of the cliff. “That was crazy!”, the old man said “I’ve never felt so alive”\n\nThe man explained that he had closed his eyes and the old man agreed to go again. He leaped from the cliff in a beautiful swan dive, and sure enough, about half way down, he opened his coat, caught the wind, and drifted back to the top of the cliff. \n\nThe man was amazed. He stepped forward towards the edge of the cliff and took another moment to collect his thoughts. \n\n“It’s easy” the old man said “the best feeling you’ve ever had”. \n\nThe man summoned the rest of his Dutch courage, unzipped his coat, and leaped from the top of the cliff. He hurtled towards the ground, opened his coat and... turned into mush as he hit the jagged rocks at terminal velocity.\n\nThe old man turned back into the bar, reached over and pulled a five pound note out of the other man’s wallet, and flagged the bartender for another whiskey. \n\nThe bartender poured his drink, placed it in front of him and said “you know, you’ve been a right prick since you retired superman!”",

The teacher and Johnny both agreed.\n\n\nPrincipal: „What is 3 x 3?“\n\n\nJohnny: „9“\n\n\nPrincipal: „6 x 6“\n\n\nJohnny „36“\n\n\nAnd so it went on like this, the principal asked him every question a third grader should know. Finally after about an hour he told the teacher „I see no reason Johnny can't go on to the third grade, he answered all of my questions right.“\n\n\nThe teacher asked if she could ask him some questions. The principal and Johnny agree.\n\n\nTeacher: „What does a cow have 4 of that I only have 2 of?“\n\n\nJohnny: „Legs“\n\n\nTeacher: „What do you have in your pants that I don't have?“ The principal gasps but before he can stop him from answering Johnny says, „pockets“\n\n\nTeacher: „What does a dog do that a man steps into?“\n\n\nJohnny: „Pants“\n\n\nTeacher: “What goes in hard and dry and comes out soft and wet?“\n\n\nJohnny: “Gum“\n\n\nTeacher: “Where do most women have curly hair?“\n\n\nJohnny: “Africa“\n\n\nTeacher: „What starts with F and ends with K and means a lot of excitement?“\n\n\nJohnny: „Firetruck“\n\n\nThe principal breaths a big sigh of relief and says „Put Johnny in the fifth grade, I got the last 6 questions wrong myself.

And so, the farmer set out to buy a rooster. He drove across the county to another farm that had many chickens and roosters.\n\nThe first farmer asks, \"I'd like to buy a rooster.\"\n\nThe second farmer says, \"No problem. What's he for?\"\n\nThe first farmer says, \"I want a rooster so that my chickens can have more chickens and lay more eggs.\"\n\nThe second farmer points to a rooster, \"Okay. Take Brewster over there... he'll do all your chickens for you.\" The rooster he pointed out was lying on his back and breathing heavily.\n\nThe first farmer exclaims, \"What? You've got to be kidding. That rooster is practically dead! He's breathing like there's no tomorrow.\"\n\nThe second farmer says, \"Don't worry, he'll do fine. I guarantee he'll do all your chickens and you'll end up with more eggs than you could ever imagine.\"\n\nWell, the first farmer thinks about it, and finally agrees, \"Okay. A guarantee is a guarantee. Sold.\" He scoops up Brewster and lays him in the back of his truck.\n\nAs soon as the farmer pulls into his yard, Brewster leaps out of the truck and grabs a chicken. After he's done with one, he does another, and another...\n\nThe farmer says, \"Take it easy Brewster! You're going to hurt yourself!\"\n\nBrewster just waves, grabs another chicken, and nails that one too. He proceeds to do all the chickens just as the other farmer had promised. When he finishes the chickens, he runs after the dog, and does him too.\n\nThe farmer is starting to get a little worried.\n\nBrewster then does the cat, the horse, and all the other farm animals too. He then starts chasing after the farmer's wife!\n\nSome time passes and the farmer can't find Brewster anywhere. He looks everywhere and eventually finds the poor rooster on his back, motionless, with a flock of vultures circling overhead.\n\nThe farmer cries out to himself, \"Oh no! I told him to be careful! Now look what's happened.\"\n\nBrewster opens one eye and whispers, \"Shhh! They're about to land.\"",

But one day, I finally decided to ask him about it.\n\n\"Grandpa, how is it that you catch so many fish while I barely get any from the same spot?\"\n\nHe just mumbled incoherently, the way he always did.  I asked him again, and he just mumbled again.

The man takes a deep breath, and launches a spit dead center into the shot glass. Amazed the bartender congratulates the man, says he's never seen anything like that and hands him $10.\n\nNext day same man walks in and tells the bartender he bets him $50 that he can spit into a shot glass with him on one end of the bar and the glass all the way at the other end. It was a pretty long bar so the bartender took the deal. The man takes an even bigger breath, aims and launches a spit that flies over the entire bar and lands dead center into the shot glass. Amazed and a little angry, the bartender reluctantly hands him the $50.\n\nThe next day the bartender eagerly awaits the man to come in so he can bet again and try to get his money back. The man walks in greets some of the other patrons,  taking his time before sitting at the bar. The bartender rushes over to him and asks \"what's the bet going to be today\" . The man says he doesn't want to keep taking his money but the bartender insists on another bet. Finally the man says to place a large glass by the store window and that from the bar he can pee into it for $50. The bartender figures there is no way that's humanly possible and tells the man he takes the bet but 8ncreases the bet to $100. The man agrees. He gets next to the bar unzips and begins peeing. He's peeing to the left, the right, he's spraying everywhich way he can to try and reach the glass. When it's all said and done the bartender and man look in the cup and there's not a drop of pee in it. The bartender jumps up and down with joy that he won. The man simple takes out a $100 and hands him the money without batting an eyelash and just simply goes back to drinking his drink and talking with other patrons. \n\nThe bartender finds this very strange and says:\n\"Aren't you upset that you lost??\"\n\n\"oh the $100? No not upset. I didn't lose\"\n\n\"what do you mean you didn't lose? You completely missed the glass!\" \n\n\"Yes I did. But you see that table of 6 over there? I bet them each $100 that I could piss all over your bar and you would be jumping for joy!\"",

This goes on for a couple years.\n\nUntil one day, she starts feeling troubled, and that she doesn't look as good as she used to.  Thinking her beauty can no longer match the pace of her aging, she goes back to the doctor.\n\n\"Doctor doctor...I've been doing what you instructed, and it worked great for a while, but now, I'm feeling older than ever...I have these huge bags under my eyes that just won't go away...\"\n\nThe doctor studies her for a minute...\n\n\"Ma'am, I'm afraid those are your tits...\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Oh..I guess that also explains my beard\"",

I haven’t thought of a good comeback yet, but I’ll get to it. \n\nShe’s been mad because I said I’d put a new coat of finish on the deck three weeks ago, and I kept putting it off because of the smell. It’s that polyurethane wood sealer they sell at hardware stores, it comes in a can like paint, you know? It gives off these wicked fumes that’ll really mess with your gourd.  \n\nWell, the other day, I’m feeling really frisky, and I want to make love to my wife. I approach her in her office, and I say, “Meaghan, I’m feeling really frisky, and I sure would like to make love to you.” But she just crosses her arms, looks me dead in the eyes, and says, “Matthew, you no-good vagrant, you can’t make love to me until you go out there, and you get on your hands and knees, and you finish that deck.” What a pistol, huh?\n\nSo I go out there, still frisky of course, and I get on my hands and knees, and I start to seal the deck. These South Carolina summers, you know, they’re very hot, and on this day it broke 100 °F. So I’m on my hands and knees, and I’m baking in the sun, and I’m breathing in the fumes, and I’M STILL FRISKY. \n\nNow, my deck isn’t huge, but it wraps around, and I want to do this right, or my wife (who’s a *pistol*, you know) is gonna make me come out here and do it all over again. Eventually, I’m about ¾ of the way done, when I see what turned out to be, uh… well, a rather shapely potted plant. Keep in mind, I’d just spent two hours huffing sealer fumes and crawling around in the 100° South Carolina sun, feeling friskier by the minute, so all I saw (pause) was my *pistol* of a wife.\n\nNaturally, I start to put my moves on my wife, who as you know, is not my wife, but is in fact a rather shapely potted plant. After about thirty sec- (pause)… after about five minutes, I’m starting to feel really good when my wife – my real actual god-damned *PISTOL* of a wife – bursts out the front door in a fervor. “MATTHEW!” she screams at me. “WHAT IN THE SAM HILL ARE YOU DOING?!” \n\nImmediately, between the sudden shock, the brutal 100° South Carolina sun, those (deep nose inhale) intoxicating sealer fumes, and – don’t forget – my pent-up friskiness (obvious wink at somebody), I gave that plant what it had been asking for.\n\nSo anyway, now huffing polyurethane sealer while polishing my wood is the only way I can finish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is meant to be told out loud, sorry if it doesn't work as well in text**",

He even jumps on the pool table and eats the cue ball.\n\nThe bartender looks furiously at the guy and says, \"what the hell man, your monkey just ate all my snacks and the cue ball off my pool table\".\n\nThe guy apologizes profusely and pays for all the food and cue ball.  He finishes his beer and leaves.\n\nA few weeks later the guy comes back with his monkey and orders a beer.  The bartender goes to pour his beer while keeping an eye on the monkey.\n\nSure enough, the monkey jumps off his shoulder, runs down to the peanuts.  \n\nHe sticks a peanut in his ass and eats it.  Grabs a piece of popcorn, sticks that in his ass and eats it.  This continues with the cherries and green olives.\n\nThe bartender looking disgusted says \"what the hell man, now he is not only eating my stuff but hes sticking it in his ass first?\".\n\nGuy replies \"yeah, ever since the cue ball incident hes been measuring everything first\".",

Just, completely gone, along with four or five of his cattle, who presumably escaped when it was removed.\n\nHe goes to try and find this fence, but to no avail for a while.  Eventually, he gives up and knocks on his neighbor’s door, who is the other rancher.  \n\nThe first rancher asks him, “Have you seen my cattle, or do you know what could have happened to my fence?”  The second rancher, whom had just opened his door began to sweat as he quickly said, “No.  I do not know.”  The second rancher quickly slammed the door.  After the door was closed, the first rancher heard a very loud mooing sound.\n\nHe looked around and it seemed to be coming from the other rancher’s barn.  He ran into it, as fast as he could, ramming open the door with all of his might.  There, he saw it.  Four of his cows, all branded, and the fence support beam lying against his wall.  The first rancher furiously screamed as he began to guide them all back into his yard, also carrying the support beam to his fence.\n\nThe second rancher stopped him about halfway to his yard, and said “Wow.  I’ve stolen your property but you’ve really taken *a fence*, huh?”",

This annoyed Ethel, and she'd taken to telling him, \"Dammit Harold, one of these days you are going to shit your guts out.\"  Harold would always just grin and go about his morning ritual.\n\nOne year for Thanksgiving, Ethel had to get up early to prep the turkey.  As she was removing the bird's giblets, she had a wonderful idea for a practical joke.  She quietly tiptoed into their bedroom while Harold was still asleep, and gently slipped some of the lumpier gibs into his boxer briefs and snuck back to the kitchen giggling to herself.\n\nAbout a half hour or so later, she heard the usual morning trumpeting but this time accompanied by a blood-curdling scream, followed by loud footsteps and the slamming of their bathroom door.  Ethel laughed to herself and went on with the meal prep.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later Harold emerged from the bathroom with a triumphant smile on his face.  \"Ethel, you were right, my morning methane had such a powerful follow through that I went and shit my guts right out.  But by the grace of God and these two fingers, everything's gonna be alright.\"",

The pope then holds up 3 fingers, and the rabbi replies by holding up a single finger. The pope then takes out bread and wine, and the rabbi takes out an apple. The pope concedes, and lets the jews stay in italy. \n\nAfter the debate is over, a young cardinal asks the pope why he conceded. The pope replies to the cardinal \n\n\"I waved my hand in the air to show that God is all around us, and he pointed to the ground to show that God is right here with us. I held up 3 fingers, symbolizing the trinity, and he held up one, symbolizing the one god we share between us. I then took out the bread and wine, a reminder of the last supper and of holy communion; and he took out an apple, symbolizing the fruit of knowledge that lead up to that moment. From that point, I knew he had me beat.\"\n\nwhile this is happening, a jew asks the rabbi how he won the debate. \n\"heck if i know, he waved his hand in the air to show that he would remove all of the jews from italy, so i pointed down to show that we're staying right here. he said we had 3 days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.\" \n\n\"and what about the last part?\" \n\n\"well he took out his lunch so i took out mine!\"",

Intrigued, he called them and asked for the plans available. \nThe operator told him that there are three plans \n\"10 pounds in a week\" \n\"20 pounds in a week\" \n\"50 pounds in a week\". \n\nExcited, John asked for the 10 pounds a week plan to be activated. \n\nNext morning a beautiful woman wearing nothing but Nike shoes and a placard on her chest knocked on John's door. The placard read, \n\n\" If you catch me you can do anything you want with me\"\n \n As soon as John read that, the woman ran away, and John followed. After 3 hours John caught her and then had his way with her. This went on for a week and John was impressed by the results. So impressed, that in fact he called the company and asked for the 20 pounds a week plan to be activated. \n\nNext morning 3 beautiful women wearing nothing but Nike shoes and a placard on their chests knocked on John's door. The placards read, \n\n\"If you catch us you can do anything you want with us\" \n\nExcited, John ran after the women, and caught all of them after 8 hours. Then He had his way with them. This also went on for a week.\n\nHis curiosity mounting, he wanted to activate the 50 pounds a week plan. When he called the company, the operator warned him, \" Are your sure? This is our toughest plan.\"\nBut John agreed and was looking forward to the women next morning. \n\nNext morning, when John opened the door, he found a 6'6\" hulking dude with popping muscles wearing nothing but Nike shoes and a placard that read, \n\"If I catch you I can do anything I want with you\"",

They could have rigged elections. They could lie about why you go to war. The prisons could be filled with one particular racial group.

Just as he's about to get a flat screen tv off of the wall, he hears the same voice from above that again says, \"Jesus is watching you.\"\n\nThis time his adrenaline shoots up as he knows for sure that the voice was not his imagination.  In panic, he shines his light back and forth across the room looking for the source of the voice; until finally, his light shines upon a big bird cage hanging from the ceiling with a parrot inside of it.\n\nThe thief breathes a sigh of relief and says, \"Oh, you're just a harmless parrot.  You had me scared for a second, haha.\"\n\nSo the thief continues working on getting the flat screen tv off of the wall.  But while he's working, he asks the parrot, \"Hey parrot, what is your name?\"\n\nThe parrot responds, \"My name is Moses.\"\n\nThe thief pauses and with a chuckle asks, \"What kind of stupid owner would name his parrot Moses?\"\n\nThe parrot replies, \"The same owner that named his rottweiler Jesus.\"",

You ride in the plane and if you don't make a sound the whole time, i'll give you your money back.\"\n\nThe man's wife reluctantly agreed, and the couple climbed into the back seat. The pilot fired up his engine and took off. Determined to make his money, the pilot did a series of barrel rolls, corkscrews, loop the loops, even climbed straight up until the engine stalled then dove straight down until he could restart it. Not a peep came from his passengers, so he levelled off and landed. He turned around and was shocked to see the old man sitting alone.\n\n\"Where's your wife?\" The pilot exclaimed.\n\n\"She fell out at the second barrel roll.\" The man replied\n\n\"Why didn't you say something? We could have landed and gone to look for her!\"\n\n\"Well, I wanted to, but 20 dollars is 20 dollars.\"",

Could you tell us how you managed to stop the bear from attacking?\n\nBill: I won't lie, as soon as I saw that bear I colasped in fear and curled up there on the ground. The bear stood over me so close I could feel his hot breath on my neck. And then in a low growl he whispered, \"Alright Bill, want to get anything off your chest before I eat you?\"\n\nInterviewer: Incredible! How did you respond?\n\nBill: There was a moment of silence as I thought and finally I said \"Yeah bear, I got to confess to some of the dirty rotten things Hillary and I did.\" \n\nInterviewer: And how did the bear respond?\n\nBill: He didn't. It was the craziest thing, I looked up and he was laying their dead. Even crazier, park ranger that did the official investigation said he committed suicide.",

No technology must be used in the temple!\" The enlightened looked at them and said, \"Master will sleep forever if we don't pass the test!\" \n\nAn hour had passed when a man knocked on the door. A pizza was delivered. \"I don't understand a pizza\" one inquired. The master awoke and rushed over. \"Pepperoni! My favorite!\" He started devouring the pizza like a glutton. \"What's going on.\" a follower inquired.\n\n\"Well, he was talking about Chi and he slept. So, Chi and Zzz will become \"Cheese!\"",

The eyes of every man in the church fall upon her as she slowly sashays up the aisle and sits down right in front of the Priest!\n\nHer dress is green and very short, with matching shiny emerald green shoes.\n\nThe priest and altar boy gasp, as the woman in the matching green shoes and dress sits with her legs slightly spread apart. The priest turns to the altar boy and whispers, “Is that Nookie Green?”\n\nThe bug-eyed altar boy can’t believe his ears but replies, “No, I think it’s just the reflection off her shoes!”",

I can’t imagine what it must be like for you to lose your brother.”\n\nThe man looks shocked, and then lets out a laugh. “Oh my goodness, I’m sorry to have worried you!

    "selftext": "Having no place to go, the poor man approaches the wooden desolate door of the old Monastery and knocks upon the door. The door opens to a rather withered old Monk, who greets the man. “I am the Head Monk of this monastery. Can I help you?” The man asks for refuge overnight and is taken up into the guest bedroom for the night. \n\nDuring the night, the man decides to take a walk around the monastery to pass the time. He comes across a old, degraded wooden door, surrounded by golden material on the hinges. He attempts to open the door but, unfortunately he fails. He goes back to sleep and in the morning, asks the head monk what was in the door. The head monk states: \n\n“Sorry, only monks are allowed to know what is within that door. I apologise.”\n\nThe man replies with “Alright, how do I become a monk then?” To which the Head Monk replies with \n\n“You must count every grain of sand on the mainland of Albion, aswell as every pebble. Then you must come back to me.” \n\nThe young trainee monk heads out on his quest to be a monk, spending over 20 years counting every grain of sand he comes across and then every pebble in a painstaking journey which nearly costs him his sanity. Throughout his entire journey, the image of that door rests solely on his mind, until he returns to the Monastery and tells the Head Monk his findings. \n\n“Very good, disciple. You are now a monk. Here is the key to the door.”\n\nThe man is handed a wooden key, which remarkably fits into the door and it opens, revealing...\n\nA silver door. He returns to the Head Monk, who then gives him a silver key. Upon unlocking the silver door, he is greeted by...\n\nA golden door. He groans and returns to the head monk, who gives him the golden key. He returns and opens the golden door, only to find...\n\nA ruby door. He goes to the monk, and screams “How many doors are left! I’m sick of this!” \n\n“It’s ok, this is the last one I promise.” He hands him a ruby encrusted key, one of the finest vintage. The newly made monk returns to the ruby door and opens the hallowed door. He gazes in absolute awe at the sight he came across. It was a sight of which nobody would’ve ever imagined they’d see in their life. You know what it was? \n\n\n\n\nI can’t tell you because you’re not a monk.",

There are three shelves in the bedroom,   with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed   in rows, covering the entire wall! It was obvious that he had taken   quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched   by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.\n\nThere   were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears   covering the length of the middle shelf,and huge, enormous bears running   all the way along the top shelf. She found it strange for an obviously   masculine guy to have such a large collection of Teddy Bears, She is   quite impressed by his sensitive side but doesn’t mention this to him.\n\nThey   share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she   finds herself thinking, \"Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!   Maybe he could be the future father of my children?’\n\nShe  turns to  him and kisses him lightly on the lips He responds warmly.  They  continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts  her in  his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off  each  other’s clothes and make hot, steamy love.\n\nShe  is so overwhelmed  that she responds with more passion, more  creativity, more heat than she  has ever known. After an intense,  explosive night of raw passion with  this sensitive guy, they are lying  there together in the afterglow. The  woman rolls over, gently strokes  his chest and asks coyly,\n\n\"Well,how was it?’\n\nThe guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says...  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n\"Help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf\"",

And he was right. The officer didn't find a single thing in the truck. It was completely empty. The officer let the driver go, but he was still suspicious.\n\nFew days later, the officer saw the same driver at the check post. The officer immediately pulled the truck aside and this time, asked other officers to thoroughly check the truck. \"Remove seat covers if you have to. And bring in every drug sniffing dog we have,\" he said staring menacingly at the truck driver. \"I'm sure he is smuggling something.\"\n\n\"Go at it. I'll wait,\" said the truck driver as he took out a cigarette.  After an hour of thorough search, the custom officer couldn't find anything.\n\n\"I know you are smuggling something, and one day, I will find it!\" he said to the driver. The driver smiled and drove away with the truck.\n\nFew days later, the Officer saw the same driver at the check post and asked him to pull the truck aside. This time, he had reinforcements and asked them to pull the truck apart, every screw, every nut, and find what the driver is hiding.\n\n\"Fine\" said the driver to the officer's frustration. They disassembled the truck, removed the engine, checked every nook and cranny, and every hollow pipe. The officer relentless looked for two days in the truck but couldn't find anything.\n\nExhausted, frustrated, and defeated, the officer went to the driver. \"I know you are smuggling something. Can you please tell me what it is? I promise i won't arrest you if you tell me. I even promise not to arrest you in the future. But for god's sake tell me what you are smuggling. This is keeping up at nights and I think I will go mad if I don't find out.\"\n\nThe driver sees the frustration and desperateness in the officer's eyes. \"Okay\" He said.\n\nThe Officer's eyes light up. \"I knew it! I knew it! Tell me,\"\n\n\"You promise you won't arrest me?\" asked the driver.\n\n\"Yes yes yes! for fuck sake! I won't. Now tell me! What are you smuggling?\"\n\n\"Trucks.\"",

I’m unsure whether to send you to Heaven and Hell. This is why, I’ve decided that for the first time in eternity, I am going to let you choose.”\n\nBill Gates replies, “That will do just fine. Just take me to Heaven and Hell and I can choose for myself.” God obliges. First they visit Heaven. Heaven is beautiful, a true sight to behold. Bill is amazed. There is every type of food imaginable, and beautiful women everywhere! However, he notices that there is no wine or alcohol. He asks God why this is. God tells him, “My son, it is seen as a sin to consume alcohol, and after all, this is heaven.”Bill thinks about this and decides it makes sense, although he is clearly disappointed. \n\nFour hours in, and Bill is getting bored, so he decides to start chatting up a woman. He talks to her a little bit and asks if she wants to go back to his place. She gasps and says, “Absolutely not! This is the Lord’s Palace! Sex before marriage is prohibited here!” \n\nBill is quite annoyed at this point and decides he has had it with Heaven. He finds God and tells him, “God, I want to see Hell.” God willingly acquiesces. He snaps his fingers and suddenly, they appear in Hell. Bill looks around and sees copious amount of alcohol flowing in rivers. He realizes that women, even more beautiful than the ones in Heaven are leading men back to their homes. Bill, without thinking twice says, “I want to go to Hell!” God acquiesces. \n\nTwo weeks pass. \n\nGod decides to check on how Bill is doing. He goes down to Hell to check on him. When he gets there he finds Bill horribly tortured and nailed to a massive cross. Bill, upon seeing God, screams, “How the hell could you do this to me? Hell is nothing like you showed me! I have been tortured horribly since I have been here and I haven’t had a speck of alcohol or sex!” God smiles and replies, “Bill, I never lied to you! This is Hell! That was just a free trial!”",

One of the things he was shown was a chart in the confessional booth with all different sins and what the penance should be. \n\nA couple days later, the replacement priest is hearing confessions. The first person comes in and tells him that he has stolen from a friend. Sure enough, when he looks at the chart, he finds theft and tells the man to say 2 Hail Marys. \n\nThe next person comes in and confessed to the priest that she has lied to her boss. The priest looks on the chart and finds lying, and tells the woman to say one our father. \n\nLater on, a woman comes in and tells the priest that she performed oral sex on her boyfriend. The priest is looking on the chart but can’t find oral sex anywhere on there. He begins to panic and opens to door where he sees one of the altar boys walking past. \n\nHe calls him over and asks him what father usually gives for oral sex.\n\nThe altar boy says “usually two candies and a soda.”",

He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.\n\nIn the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.\n\nWith his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.\n\nHe didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.\n\nWell, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.\n\nAs the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.\n\nBut the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.\n\n“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”\n\nJacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”",

But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.”\n\nSeveral days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: “Dear Son, I’m not saying that you ‘do’ sleep with Julie, and I’m not saying that you ‘do not’ sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom.”",

The bartender, while bringing a new round of drinks to their table, overhears their rating of the young lass. He checks her out himself and says, \"Nah, I'd only give her a 2.\" \"A 2? How can you give her a 2?\" says one of the three guys at the table. \"She's a real pretty girl.\" The bartender, walking away, says, \"Well, I use the Budweiser method for rating women.\" The guys look at each other, figure the bartender has lousy taste in women, and go back to their ratings. Moments later, another young lady, prettier than the last, walks into the bar, and they confer between themselves and decide she deserves a 9. However, the bartender, wiping off the table nearest to theirs, again overhears their rating of the gal. He checks her out himself and tells the fellows that he'd only give her a 5. \"A 5? How can you give her just a 5? She's absolutely gorgeous!\" The bartender casually replies that he uses the Budweiser method for rating women. \"The Budweiser method?\" they puzzle, as the bartender returns to his post behind the bar. They are quite confused. Three, maybe four minutes pass by, and then a stunning blonde, 5'11\" goddess walks into the bar. Long luscious legs, sexy shape. Truly a work of flawless perfection. Without hesitation, the three \"judges\" at the table determine that this young sultress is, without any doubt, a 10. However, carrying a case of beer pass them to restock the supply behind the bar, the bartender once more overhears their rating of the girl. He glances studiously at her, and says that the best, the very best that he could give her, would be a 7. \"A 7? How in the world could you give her just a mere 7? She's gorgeous!\" \"Well,\" says the bartender again, \"I use the Budweiser method for rating women.\" \"Budweiser!\" says one of the guys, exasperated. \"What in the Hell is this 'Budweiser method' for rating women?\" \"Well, says the bartender, \"the Budweiser method for rating women, is the number of Clydesdales it would take to pull me off her.\"",

    "selftext": "He did expect a light at the end of the tunnel and all that, but he decides to see where things are going. Pretty soon, the destination of his elevator-ride is showing up on the display: \"Hell\" \n\n\"Well\", the man thinks, \"I've had a good life. Fair's fair I guess.\" \n\nThe elevator opens and to his surprise hell isn't all fire and brimstone - it's a lush meadow with a pleasant blue sky and a small man in a white suit waiting for him, a beaming smile on his face. \n\n\"Excuse me\", the man asks, \"I think I'm at the wrong place.\" \n\n\"No, no, I assure you, this is alright\", the man in the white suit says. \"This is indeed hell. And yes, I am the Devil.\" \n\nThe man is surprised but decides not to question it. Instead he asks: \"Can I have a look around?\" \n\n\"Feel free\", the Devil encourages him. \n\nSo the man walks around and finds hell to be rather pleasant. People sitting at swimming pools, laughing, talking, enjoying what seems to be the best food afterlife has to offer. But after a while, he notices a huge wall in the distance. Curious, he approaches and finds that the wall seems to be stretching infinitely in both directions. He follows it for a while and eventually spots a crack which he looks through. \n\nOn the other side, it's hell in the worst sense: Fire is everywhere. People are screaming in agonizing pain as red-hot hooks are pierced through their skin. They are boiled alive, every bone in their body gets broken and demons of all shapes and sizes laugh at their pain. Struck with horror, the man turns around to run but freezes as he sees the Devil standing behind him. \n\n\"What's up with that wall?\", the man asks in horror. \n\n\"Oh, that\", the devil says offhandely. \"That's the Christians. It's the way they want it.\"",

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the Chairman of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.\n\nAfter many lengthy discussions (after all, the customer is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the Chairman's office.\n\nThe chairman of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, \"£165,000\". The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.\n\nThe chairman was surprised and asked, \"What kind of bets?\"\n\nThe elderly woman replied, \"Well, I bet you      £25,000  that your testicles are square.\"\n\nThe chairman started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.\n\nThe woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the chairman and said, \"Would you like to take my bet?\"\n\n\"Certainly\", replied the Chairman. \"I bet you £25,000 that my testicles are not square.\"\n\n\"Done\", the elderly woman answered. \"But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.\" \"No problem\", said the chairman of the Bank confidently.\n\n\nThat night, the chairman became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.\n\nThe next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the chairman's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the £25,000 bet made the day before that the chairman's testicles were square.\n\nThe chairman confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his trousers etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.\n\nThe chairman was happy to oblige.\n\nThe elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the chairman if she could touch them. \"Of course\", said the chairman. \"Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.\"\n\nThe elderly woman did so with a little smile.\n\nSuddenly the chairman noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, \"Oh, it's probably because I bet him £100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the Chairman of the Bank of England !\"",

I'm saying absolutely atrocious. \n\nThe handsome man grimaces but says nothing rude, and returns to talking to the girls.

An hour later, the ugly man has left with EVERY. SINGLE. GIRL. In the bar. The Handsome man is indignant at this, as he should by every right have been with the girls. He turns to the bartender and says:\n\nI don't understand! Here I am, handsome and humorous, but the women all leave with the potato!

He approaches the bartender and asks, \"What's with the money in the jar?\"\n\n\"Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus\"\n\nThe man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, \"What are the three tests?\"\n\n\"You gotta pay first,\" says the bartender, \"those are the rules.\"\n\nSo, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.\n\n\"Okay,\" says the bartender, \"here's what you need to do:\n\nFirst - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.\"\n\n\"Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.\"\n\n\"Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.\"\n\nThe man is stunned! \"I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!\"\n\n\"Your call,\" says the bartender, \"but, your money stays where it is.\"\n\nAs time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, \"Where's the damn tequila?!\"\n\nHe grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds! Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!\n\nJust when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body. He drunkenly says, \"Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?\"",

Desiring to keep his passengers happy he says, “Ma’am on behalf of the railroad company please allow me to apologize for the vulgar behavior of that gentleman.

It also looks very malnourished and often famished due to its eating habits because it only feasts when it can find its type of prey that it most desires.\n\nAll of the children look very confused, so instead of asking if any of them know the answer the teacher decides to give them one final clue and then see if anybody can guess.\n\n\"Okay children, this is your final clue. The creature were talking about feasts upon the souls of the innocent, and derives pleasure from the misery of others.\n\nLittle Johnny raises his hand and excitedly says \"I know, I know, I know, it's a vampire!\"\n\n\"Oh, so close Johnny.

All 1,000 of them die with 0 casualties on the rebel's side. The entire army under Macklemore attacks Us, and loses. Attack after attack after attack fails.\n\nMacklemore Can't Hold Us.",

Having always teached in high level schools, full of wealthy kids from good neighborhoods, that was honestly not hard. \n\nOne year, tho, the teacher was sent to a school in a really bad neighborhood in Rome, full of mildly poor kids from not so good families. \n\nSo one day the teacher tells the students to find a story as an assignment, which they will have to tell to the class the next day. They can tell whatever story they want, but on one condition: the story must have a moral. \n\nThe next day, the first kid to tell his story is a little white boy, with nice hair, all good dressed and very serious. So he starts telling the story of David and Goliath, and when he's finished he says that the moral of his story is that brain always wins over muscles. \"Very good\" says the teacher, and all the kids go on with telling their stories, everyone bringing good ones, with nice morals.\n\nThen it's the turn of the last kid, with his leather jacket and spiked hair. A kid from a really difficult household, not very good at school.\n\nSo he goes in front of the class and starts telling his story.\n\n\"So... I wanted to tell the story of the White Knight and the Black Knight. So the White Knight is an honest and good man and a really good knight, who likes to help poor people, and he always wins all the jousts by playing fairly and honestly and never cheating. The Black Knight is a bold young man who doesn't care about justice and always wins his jousts by cheating.\"\n\nNoticing the actual efforts the kid is putting in the story, the teacher encourages him, thinking he finally understood that school is important and is finally convinced to try his best.\n\n\"So one day, the Black Knight is angry at the White Knight because he wins all the jousts and everyone thinks he's the best knight, so he dares him to have a joust with him. So they do and the Black Knight kills the White Knight.\"\n\n\"Oh... I didn't expect that.\" Says the teacher. \"But nevermind, go on with the story.\"\n\n\"So the White Knight had three sons, who all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their father. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the three of them.\"\n\nAt this point the teacher is perplexed, but decides to just let the kid go on and see what he has.\n\n\"So each of the three sons had three sons, and they all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their fathers. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the... nine of them.\" says the kid, counting on his fingers.\n\n\"So each of the nine sons had three sons, and they all challenge the Black Knight to have jousts with them to avenge their fathers. The Black Knight accepts, and kills all the...\" He starts counting with his little fingers again, but the teacher stops him.\n\n\"Dear God, ok, but what's the moral of the story?\"\n\nThe kid just looks at him for a couple second, his fingers still up in the motion of counting.\n\n\"Well, the moral is just don't fuck with the Black Knight!\"",

We better not.\"\n\nSo Bob gets disappointed and they leave.\n\nSome years later they see the same helicopter again. Bob tried to convince Harriet to let them go, but she said \"$50 is $50.\"\n\nBob sulks off again, disappointed.\n\nThis cycle goes on for several years, with Bob wanting to ride the helicopter but Harriet saying \"$50 is $50.\"\n\nWhen they're in their 80's, they see the helicopter at the fair again. Bob really badly wants to go and decides to convince her one last time.\n\nBob: \"Look, we're both old now. We may not live long enough to make it to the next fair. This might be our last chance!\"\n\nHarriet shakes her head and says \"Honey, $50 is $50. It's too expensive. I'm sorry.\"\n\nBob's face falls and he mumbles \"okay\" as they walk away.\n\nNow the pilot of the helicopter has been watching this same couple come every year for the past couple decades and decides he wants to help them out. So he approaches the couple and offers them a deal: if they can stay quiet the whole time he's flying, he'll let them on for free. Harriet finally agreed and they go on the helicopter ride.\n\nIt was awesome! The pilot was doing all kinds of crazy moves: loop-d-loops, twirls, rolls, all kinds of stuff you thought a helicopter couldn't do.\n\nWhen they finish, the pilot is surprised. The old couple managed to stay quiet! \n\nPilot: \"Wow! I thought for sure you guys would scream, but you didn't! Congratulations, you got it free!\"\n\nBob chuckles and says \"Well I almost said something when Harriet fell out the window, but you know: $50 is $50.\"",

Recognising his daughters raging hormonal moods of late, Farmer Joe puts the word out in town that it’s time to find her a husband. \n\nThere is no shortage of guys in town who would love to snap her up and sure enough Farmer Joe gets a knock on the door that same night from a young local interested in Lucy.\n\nJoe examines the young man who seems strong and work fit and tells him he wants to make sure his daughter is happy in all aspects of her life including her love life so he asks the young lad to pass a test. \n\nHe says, “I’ve got a cow in the barn out back, she’s in heat atm and won’t shut up with her mooing. If you can shut her up and satisfy her, you should have no problem with my daughter”. The young lad agrees, and starts his test while Joe goes back inside to wait. Sure enough the cow stoops mooing right away.\n\nAn hour goes by,...two hours...three hours...four hours. 7 hours later the sun is up and Joe decides to go an check up on the the lad. \n\nHe opens the barn door and the lad is still going at it sweating and huffing. Joe says “Jesus boy, that’s enough you can have my daughter”\n\nThe young lad responds, “Fuck, your daughter!..How much you want for this cow?”",

If the parent walked down at all, the child would not be healed.\nA poor woman who's baby was desperately ill traveled for many miles and came to the base of the mountain. \n\nThere she met a small boy with some drums who told her to take courage, that his name was Benny and that the trek would be hard but the end would be worth it.\n\nSo she hiked up the mountain.\n\nA quarter of the way up she met a woman playing a piano who told her. \"My my name is Ethel. Stay strong, you baby will be made well.\n\nSo she continued on.\n\nHalf way up the mountain she met a little girl who played a violin and said. My name is Emily. Drink from this stream if you're thirsty. It's not far now. Stay strong.\n\nSo the woman continued on and on.  A fog rolled in. She despaired and thought about giving up.\nLittle did she know she was only 5 minutes from the magic cradle.\n \nSuddenly the fog parted and there stood 5 men in front of her, the closest with a guitar in his hands.\nHe struck a mighty chord and yelled.\n\nWE ARE AC/DC! \nAND IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP IF YOU WANNA ROCK AND ROLL!",

He tops the largest hill in sight when he can see it. \n\nIt’s the most beautiful city he could’ve possibly imagined.

When I got outside, the cops had the woman on the ground. They were putting the fire out!! Then they put handcuffs on her and threw her in the police car. I was thinking, arrested?? She should be in an ambulance, not a cop car! Being the nosey person that I am, I asked what they were arresting her for?

We need to change immediately!\"\n\n\"Naaah man, don't worry about it, there aren't any big icebergs in these waters!\" The captain answers, sending the cadet out once more.\n\nFeeling a little bit too buzzed, the captain places his joint on the table, in order to take a break from the smoking.\n\nMeanwhile the cadet outside on his post sees the skip is about to hit the iceberg, so once more he walks to the bridge to warn the captain.\n\nHe bursts into the room, once more a huge cloud of smoke hits him right in his face. The cadet raises his hand and points at the joint:\n\n\"Yo, you gonna hit that?\"",

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.\n \nWell, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.\n \nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.\n \n\"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said, \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\"",

    "selftext": "A man is out in the Chinese wilderness and he's hopelessly lost. It's been nearly three weeks since he's eaten anything besides what he could forage and he's been reduced to sleeping in caves and under trees.\n\nOne afternoon he comes upon an old mansion in the woods.  It has vines covering most of it and the man can't see any other buildings in the area. However, he sees smoke coming out of the chimney implying someone is home.\n\n\nHe knocks on the door and an old man answers, with a beard almost down to the ground. The old man squints his eyes and says \"What do you want?\"\n\n\nThe man says \"I've been lost for the past three weeks and haven't had a decent meal or sleep since that time. I would be most gracious if I could have a meal and sleep in your house for tonight.\" \n\n\nThe old Chinese man says \"I'll let you come in on one condition: You cannot mess around with my daughter.\" \n\n\nThe man, exhausted and hungry readily agrees, saying \"I promise I won't cause you any trouble. I'll be on my way tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\nThe old Chinese man counters \"Ok, but if I do catch you then I'll give you the three worst Chinese torture tests ever known to man.\"\n\n\n\"Ok, Ok\" the man said as he entered the old house. Besides, he thought to himself, what kind of woman would live out in the wilderness all her life? \n\n\nWell, that night, when the man came down to eat (after showering), he saw how beautiful the daughter was. She was an absolute pearl, and while he had only been lost three weeks, it had been many, many months without companionship. And the girl had only seen the occasional monk besides her father and well, they both couldn't keep their eyes off each other throughout the meal.\n\n\nThat night, the man snuck into the girls' bedroom and they had quite a time, but had kept the noise down to a minimum. The man crept back to his room later that night thinking to himself, \"Any three torture tests would be worth it after that experience.\" \n\n\nWell, the next morning the man awoke to a heavy weight on his chest. He opened his eyes and there was this huge rock on his chest. On the rock was a sign saying \"First Chinese torture test: 100 lb rock on your chest\".\n\n\n\"What a lame torture test. Is this the best the old man can do?\" the man thought to himself as he got up and walked over to the window. He opened the shutter and threw the rock out. On the backside of the rock is another sign saying \"Second worst Chinese torture test: Rock tied to right testicle\".\n\n\nThe man, seeing the rock was too far out the window to be grabbed, jumps out the window after the rock, figuring broken bones was better than castration. Outside the window is a third sign saying \"Third worst Chinese torture test: Left testicle tied to bedpost\".",

    "selftext": "... had a particularly rough childhood because of her uncommon name. She always got a lot of teasing and abuse at school and hated her parents for the pain they inflicted on her. By the time she graduated school, however, she overcame her anger and embraced her unusual name finding it brought her some fame as a competitive soccer player. \n\nDarling met and married a handsome veterinarian named Chorus who worked at an African wildlife reserve and, in time, they had a baby boy. Despite the hardships she endured, she demanded that the child also have a unique name but she didn’t want the boy to know it was her idea. She told the father that the boy’s name would be “Love” and that he had to pretend that it was his idea. He reluctantly agreed.\n\nDarling’s soccer career flourished and Chorus became head of pachyderm health at the wildlife reserve. As Love grew, he endured the same ridicule and taunting that his mother did. Love’s father continued to cover for his wife's decision and argued that in time he would learn to appreciate his unique name. \n\nOne day, Chorus was at work preparing a tranquilizer gun to work on an elephant when Love burst into his office. Love raged about the misery his name had caused him but Chorus kept up the pretense that the name was his own idea. Love grabbed the tranquilizer gun and shot his father with one of the potent darts before fleeing.\n\nChorus struggled for life aware that the elephant tranquilizer would kill him in a few short minutes. Darling, returning from a soccer practice found her husband struggling on the floor in his last moments of consciousness. Rushing to him, she held him in her arms and asked what happened? With his last labored breath\n\n\nChorus:\n\n&gt; Shot with a dart and you’re to blame, Darling. \n&gt; \n&gt; You gave Love a bad name. \n&gt; \n&gt; I played my part while you played your game. \n&gt; \n&gt; You gave love a bad name.”",

Mike asks if Mars has a stockmarket, if they have laptop computers, how they make money, etc. \nFinally, Maureen brings up the subject of sex. \"Just how do you guys do it?\" asks Maureen. \"Pretty much the way you do,\"responds the Martian. Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. \nMaureen and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He's got only a teeny, weeny member about half an inch long and just a quarter inch thick. \n“I don't think this is going to work,” says Maureen. \n\"Why?\" he asks, \"What's the matter?\" \n\"Well,\" she replies, \"It's just not long enough to reach me!\" \n\"No problem,\" he says, and proceeds to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead,  his member grows until it's quite impressively long. \n\"Well,\" she says, \"That's quite impressive, but it's still pretty narrow....\" \n\"No problem,\" he says, and starts pulling his ears. With each pull,his member grows wider and wider until  the entire measurement is extremely exciting to the woman. \n\"Wow!\" she exclaims, as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love. The next day the couples rejoin their normal partners and go their separate ways. As they walk along, Mike asks \"Well, was it any good?\" \n\"I hate to say it,\" says Maureen, \"but it was pretty wonderful. How about you?\" \n\"It was horrible,\" he replies, All I got was a headache. All she kept doing the whole time was slapping  my forehead and pulling my ears.\"",

The boy smiled at the young woman and she started up a conversation with him. As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.\n\nAfter a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, \"Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.\"\n\nHe followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, \"What would you say is my best feature?\"\n\nFlustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, \"It has to be your ears.\"\n\nAstounded, and a little hurt she asked, \"My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere. How can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?\"\n\nClearing his throat, he stammered, \"Outside, when you said you heard someone coming...that was me.\"",

Joe decided that if he was going to make a move it was now or never. He worked up the courage to go up to Ashley and ask her if she'd go to prom with him. To his suprise she said yes!\n\nJoe was so excited and wanted the night to be perfect so he talks with her friends and agrees to setup the limo. Before leaving he makes sure to get prom tickets for himself and Ashley. There's a line of students waiting and he gets nervous because he wanted to leave early to rent the limo. He gets to the front, buys his tickets, and hurries on his way. He goes to the rental place and waits in line with everyone else looking to rent a limo for prom. He gets to the front and arranges everything, proud of himself because he didn't let the group down. Next he goes to rent a tux and finds that there's another line at this store. He waits while everyone else gets fitted and finally makes it to the front. He's worried that they may not have any left in his size but to his relief the store is prepared for prom season and Joe is able to get one in his size. Last on the list is a corsage for Ashley. He makes his way to the flower shop and encounters yet another line, which at this point he expected. He waits in line with everyone else and finally completes his to do list with a lovely corsage for his date.\n\nFinally prom night is here and Joe more nervous and excited than he's ever been before. He gets to Ashley's house and she looks stunning. He gives her the corsage, her friends show up with their dates, everyone takes photos and they head to prom in the limo. Everything is going great and Joe is finally starting to relax. \n\nThey arrive at prom and they spot a photobooth. Ashley and Joe get in line and  Joe starts to worry that Ashley might get bored. He's happy to see this line is moving more quickly than the one's he was in earlier and they have fun chatting while they wait. They get to the front and take their pictures. Ashley even gives Joe and kiss on the cheek in one of them.\n\nJoe cant believe how well the night is going. He asks Ashley if she's thirsty, she says yes so he goes to get them some punch. He makes his way over to the refreshment table and there's no punchline.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer skipping to the end will ruin the joke, but it is best said in person to a group of people. Enjoy!  \n\n\nOne morning a young boy was walking to class when three older girls approached the boy and said well aren't you just a \"purple vein\". The boy asked but the girls giggled as they slowly rounded the block. \n\nAfter the boy got to school he saw his best friend and asked him. \"Hey I was walking to class and these three older girls called me a purple vein. Any idea what it means?\" His best friend of his short lived elementary experience looked at him with shock and disgust. Appallingly he said \"How could you!? I'm telling Mrs. Reevus!\"\n\nMrs. Reevus comes up to the boy and asks him what is going on? The boy replies \"Well I was walking to school and these three girls called me a purple vein, then I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, do you know what it means Mrs. Reevus?\" The teacher with a sour scowl etched across her face told the boy. \"Son that is enough! Go the principle's office at once!\"\n\nThey boy is waiting in the principal's office when he hears the principal behind the closed door, the boy sees his principal's shadow through the sand blasted door window. Imprinted says 'Principal McDouglas: Hopkins Elementary'. The well dressed Principal opens the door and says come on in young man. As the boy is entering the room Mr. McDouglas says \"What is the nature of your presence in my office?\" They boy replies with fear of repetition of the past but none-the-less he says \"Well I was walking to school today when three girls approached me and called me a purple vein. I got to school and asked my best friend what a purple vein was, then I talked to the teacher and asked her what a purple vein was, now I am asking you Mr. McDouglas do you know what a purple vein is?\" The Principal had been waiting his whole life for a student like this he takes a deep breath clearly filled with frustration and says \"Son get out of this school! You are expelled. Do not ever try to come back!\"\n\nSuddenly the boy is walking home in tears over today's events so far. He gets home and see his mom is doing house chores. He wipes his tears and has the secure feeling of being in his home. She says \"You're home early, everything okay?\" The boy choked as he began to speak \"Well M-M-Mom I was walking to school today when three girls called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me, I talked to the teacher and asked her what a purple vein was, she sent me to the principal, I asked the principal he expelled me, mom do you know what a purple vein is?\" The mother with much disgust look as if she witnessed her son murdering their family pet. She said to the boy \"Go to your room! Do not come out till your father gets home, you hear me boy!\" The boy in tears again says \"Yes, Mother..\"\n\nAfter a few hours with what seemed like forever the father arrives home and the boy is nervously anticipating his father's future approach. Soon he hears him coming up the stairs in a not so relaxed pace, his father opens the door and yells \"What did you do to your mother!?\" The boy tears flowing down his face stuttered out \"Dad I was walking to school and these three girls called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me to the teacher, I asked the teacher what a purple vein was and she sent me to the principal, I then asked the principal what a purple vein was and he expelled me from the school, I got home and asked mom what a purple vein was and she sent me to my room, now dad do you know what a purple vein is?\" His dad with fever and disgust says \"Get out of my house and never come here again! You're not my son anymore!\"\n\nThe boy had no place to go or knowledge of what to do. He saw a old hobo lady sitting on a bench in the park. He approached the woman and she seemed of warm spirit and cheered him up a bit before she starting asking why he was all by his lonesome. The boy replied \" Well I was walking to school when three girls approached me and called me a purple vein, I got to class and asked my friend what a purple vein was, he told on me to the teacher, I asked the teacher what a purple vein was, she sent me to the principal, I asked him what a purple vein was and he expelled me, I got home and asked mom what a purple vein was and she told on me to my dad, who I asked what a purple vein was and he kicked me out of the house and family. Old hobo lady do you know what a purple vein is?\" The lady look at him and said \"No I do not, but do you see that castle across the street up the hill with the dark clouds and lightning? If you go there, there is a man who knows all and will have your answer.\"\n\nThe boy is hopeful and almost crosses the street before getting hit by a bus..

You leaned against the fence and I made love to you from behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she says, I remember it well.\" she replies.\r\n\r\n\"OK, he says, How about taking a stroll round there again and we can do it for old times sake?\"\r\n\r\nSmiling his wife responds, \"Oh Henry, you devil, that sounds like a good idea, she answers.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a man sitting at the next table listening to all this, having a chuckle to himself. He thinks, I've got to see this, two old timers having sex against a fence. So he follows them. \r\n\r\nThey walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for support, aided by walking sticks. Finally they get to the back of the barn and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down and the old man drops his trousers. She turns around and hangs on to the fence and the old man moves in. Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex the watching man has ever seen. They are bucking and jumping like eighteen-year-olds. This goes on for about forty minutes. She's yelling Ohhh God! He's hanging on to her hips for dear life. \r\n\r\nThis is the most athletic sex imaginable. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground. The guy watching is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life that he didn't know. He starts to think about his own aged parents and wonders whether they still have sex like this. \r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The guy, still watching thinks, That was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I've got to ask him what his secret is. \r\n\r\nAs the couple pass, the guy says to them, \"That was something else, you must have been shagging for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? Is there some sort of secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there's no secret, the old man says, except fifty years ago that fucking fence wasn't electrified.\"",

I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.\"\n\nThe Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.\n\"No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!\" commented Trump. \n\nThe Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.\n\nTrump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, \"Yeah, I can handle this.\"\n\nThe Devil smiled and said, \"Monica, you're free to go!\"",

When 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling. Some were considered prime suspects in 9’s death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7.

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”\nThe man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”\nThe monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”\nThe monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\nFinally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”\nThe man is relieved to no end.\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\nBut I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",

The people in this town are known to be particularly stupid. I think I know a way we can trick them. Take off that saddle and that feed-bag from that horse and put them on me. Then you take the horse and let me do the rest. We'll meet up at our safe house outside of town!\".\n \nSo they do this. The thief with the horse escapes into the night, and the other thief stands at the hitch - wearing a saddle and a feedbag on his face! Eventually the local farmer comes out of the tavern...\n \n\"Where is my horse?!?\" the farmer exclaims.  \n  \nThe thief says to him: \"I'm right here, don't you recognize me? I used to be a man, just like you. But several years ago I had sex with an evil witch and she cursed me to be a horse for a long time. But the curse is over, now!\"\n \nThe farmer says \"Oh my Lord! What a tragic tale!  You've been a horse all these years? My horse? Can you ever forgive me for all the times I whipped you and worked you so hard for my own ease and comfort?\" \n \nThe thief thought about it for a second and cagily said: Well... I have nothing in this world. If you could give me $50 to help me get  back on my feet again, I would really appreciate it!\" \n \nSo the old farmer gave him the $50 and the thief went on his way. \n \nSeveral months later the farmer was selling his crops several towns over when he saw his old horse on sale in the market for $50. \n \nTo which the farmer replied: \"Old boy... you really need to learn to stay away from those witches!\"",

The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in). The battle raged, and when the dust had cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms, thus proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides. ",

Let's go see Rabbi Spiegel, the eldest of all of us.\"\n\nSo the three go see Rabbi Spiegel. \"Rabbi, all of our sons are going around saying they're Christians!\" the men complain. \n\n\"Funny you should say that,\" says Rabbi Spiegel. \"My son, 30 years he's a Jew, and then bam! He's a Christian now.\" The rabbi gets serious. \"The only thing we can do is take this straight to Jehovah.\" And the Rabbi kneels and prays, \"Oh, mighty God, our sons have been good Jews for 30 years now, but now they're going around saying they're Christians!\" \n\nAnd a voice booms down from heaven... \"Funny you should say that...\"",

You tell them if they want to hear a joke or if they have yet to hear it, the joke about a pimp and his THREE hoes. So it goes like this:\n\nSo their was a pimp walking down a block that he had THREE hoes working on. The THREE hoes were spread apart on the block. Each one of the THREE hoes had a corner of her own.\n\nThe pimp walks up to the first hoe and says \"where's my 150 dollars?\". The hoe then says \"150? I only owe you 125 dollars\". The pimp then slaps her and tells her \"bitch! Don't correct me.\" The hoe then gives the pimp all the money that she's made.\n\nThe pimp now finds his way to his 2nd hoe and says \"where's my 175$?\". The hoe says \"175? I only owe you 150\". The pimp slaps the second hoe and tells her like he did the first \"bitch! Don't correct me.\" He takes the money and moves on. \n\nSo now the pimp is at his THIRD hoe and yet again, demands his money. He tells the THIRD hoe \"where's my 200 dollars?\" The hoe says \"200$? I only owe you 175.\" Once again just like the others, he slaps his THIRD hoe and says \"bitch! Don't correct me\". Collects his money and keeps it moving.\n\nSo now the pimp finds his way to his 4th hoe......\n\n\nNow if and when the person your telling the joke to says some thing like \"but wait. I thought you said he only had 3 hoes\" then this is where you slap the taste out of their mouth and tell them \"bitch! Don't correct me\"",

Finally the Ringmaster steps into the spotlight and announces, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the act you've all been waiting for!  The Amazing Goldstien!\"\n\nA frail-looking small man with wire-rim glasses and thinning hair steps into the spotlight and approaches a table with three walnuts lying on it.  He whips out his massive two-foot long penis, uses it to whack each walnut in turn and cracks them open!  The crowd leaps to their feet and break into thunderous applause!  Our local man is astounded.\n\n20 years later, he happens across the same poster, still advertising: \"And the Amazing Goldstien!\".  \"My God,\" he thinks, \"He was ancient the last time!\"\n\nSure enough, they save the best for last, and Goldstien slowly walks out.  Now completely bald, he is bent over and even shorter than last time.  His glasses are now very thick.\n\nHe walks up to a table that has three coconuts on it and repeats his performance from 20 years before.  The crowd goes wild!\n\nOur local guy just has to talk to him, so he finagles his way backstage after the show.  He introduces himself to Goldstien and says, \"Last time, you used walnuts.  Why the coconuts?\"\n\nGodstien replies, \"Well, my eyes aren't what they used to be!\"",

Every day since they were small children, they'd go down to their river banks and yell at each other across the river. They never really met each other because neither one could swim and neither one had a boat. So for years and years, every day, they'd just cuss at each other across the river.\n\nBoudreaux would scream things at Clarence like, \"Imma gonna come ovuh they one day and whup yuh ass so hard yuh gonna hava sheet otta yuh nose!\"\n\nClarence would scream back, \"yah, you come on ovuh hey and try da whup muh ass and I gonna stomp yuh face intu da ground and make boodan otta yuh head!\"\n\nOne day, news spread throughout the bayou that the county was going to build a bridge across the river. Boudreaux was extremely happy. In glee, he said to his wife, \"Sha, Imma finally gonna get to go whup that Clarence's ass!\"\n\nSo, for months Boudreaux anxiously waited for the bridge to be completed until one day a neighbor came over and told Boudreaux that the bridge was done!\n\nSo he kissed his wife and said, \"I'm gonna cross dat bridge and whup Clarence's ass and be back by suppa!\" and off he went.\n\nLater that evening, Boudreaux came back to his house looking sad and dejected. His wife asked, \"did you get to whup that Clarence's ass?\"\n\nBoudreaux said, \"Nah Sha, never saw him.  I ran away ‘cause it turns out he's ah big, big man. I mean a reeeally big, big man. If Ida gone ova they, he would have whupped me...probably even kilt me.\"\n\nBoureaux's wife then asked, \"How d'ya know he's a big man if yuh never saw him?\"\n\nBoudreaux said, \"Well, I got to da bridge and dey was a big sign that said 'Clearance 12 Feet 6 Inches'!\"",

He sits down sets his ducks on the bar and has a few drinks. The bartender doesn't say anything because he would rather a weird customer with ducks than no customers at all. After a few drinks the patron gets up to use the restroom and leaves the ducks with the bartender.\n\nAn awkward silence fills the room and the bartender decides to break it up with some small talk. He turns to the first duck and asks him\n\n\"Whats your name duck? How was your day?\n\nThe first duck replies: \"My name is Luey and my day was freaking amazing! It was the best day ever! I was in and out of Puddles all freaking day and it was great. Id do it every day for the rest of my existence if I could!\"\n\nThe bartender nods his head and thinks to himself, damn that does sound like a good day for a duck. He then turns to the second duck and repeats the question: \"Hey whats your name and how was your day?\"\n\nThe second duck exclaims \"My name is Huey and my day was also freaking amazing. I was in and out of Puddles all freaking day and Id do it a million times over if I could!\"\n\nAt this point the bartender is pretty bored speaking with the ducks and is pretty confident he knows what the third duck did. So he turns to the third duck and states \"Soo let me guess your name is Stuey and you had a great day in and out of puddles as well?\"\n\nThe third duck looks straight at the bartender with a disgusted face and says \n\n\"NO my name is Puddles and don't ask me how my fucking day went!!!!\"\n\n- Poor Puddles",

In over 20 years I've never laughed at a patient.\"\n\n\"OK then,\" said Bob who then proceeded to drop his pants, revealing the smallest penis the nurse had ever seen.  In length and width it was almost identical to a AAA battery.\n\nUnable to control herself, the nurse tried to stop a giggle, but it just came out.  Feeling very bad that she had laughed at the man's genitals, she composed herself as well as she could. \"I'm very sorry,\" she said, \"I don't know what came over me. On my honour as a nurse and a lady, I promise it won't happen again.  Now tell me, what seems to be the problem?\".\n\n\"It's swollen,\" Bob replied.\n\nShe ran out of the room.",

    "title": "So a guy walks into a bar...",
    "selftext": "So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”\n\nSo the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”\nAnd the guy’s, like, “World peace.”\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”\nAnd the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”\nAnd all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”\n\nAnd the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. \nAnd he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.\n\nSo the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”\nAnd the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Well done.”\n\nAnd then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\nAnd the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",

He could see a Native man getting out of the vehicle and walking towards him. Next thing he heard was a huge BANG! The fellow changing his tire jumped and looked up to see that the Native had smashed the driver door window. \"What the hell are you doing\" yelled the owner of the vehicle... the Native replied \"well if your gonna steal the tires... I'm gonna take the radio too!\"",

The birth was a regular vaginal birth, and to the relief of everyone, it was much less complicated then the one in 1776. Anyways, now it was time to give name for the new born nation. The British Empire tired from the labour and delivery, decided to leave the naming responsibilities to the founding fathers. The 3 founding fathers each had a name they liked and quarrelled with each other for some time. Then they decided to use the same tactic they used in naming the older brother, USA. The three of them would each pick a letter from a hat and the 3 letters would become the name.\n\nFirst founding fathers picks a letter from the hat, \"C, eh.\"\nSecond goes, \"N, eh.\"\nAnd finally the third goes, \"D, eh.\"",

He is feeling a little beat-up by the stresses of city life, and he concludes that a leisurely drive in the country would do him a world of good. So, he rents a car, and he sets off on his quest to find some peace of mind.\n\nAs he drives along a beautiful country road, he sees something odd in the distance. As he gets closer, he can see that it is a farmer standing under a tree near the road holding a pig. Curious, he pulls to the side of the road. He watches intently as the farmer picks up one pig after another to let them eat an apple from the tree. This curious behavior fascinates the businessman as he watches this go on for several minutes. Finally, he can no longer contain himself. He calls out to the farmer, “Excuse me sir, but what exactly are you doing?” The farmer calmly replies, “Why, feeding the pigs, of course.” The businessman is a little surprised. He calls out to the farmer again, “But, wouldn’t it save a lot of time if you just shook the tree to cause the apples to fall to the ground so that the pigs could eat them there?” The farmer looks at the businessman, confused, and he replies, “Time? Pigs got no concept of time!”",

The bear plunges into the water and the Minister announces,  \"I baptize you in the name of the Father,  Son,  and Holy Ghost.\"  \"That's just a start,\" exclaims the Priest.   He lays communion wafers on the bank and beckons the bear forward.   The bear reaches the bank and gobbles down the wafers.   The Priest says,  \"The Body of Christ,\" and with that the race up the hillside to their camp.   When they get there they notice the Rabbi isn't with them.   After a few minutes they get worried and head back down the trail.   They come to the streambank and find the Rabbi: bruised,  bloody,  but, thankfully, still alive.   They ask him what happened.  He moans and says,  \"Oy. I never should have started with circumcision.\"",

    "selftext": "He worked late that night, and the sun had already fallen below the sky. The man enjoyed the two mile walk to work in the morning, but the cold of the night made the way back numb, rigid, and surreal. The man followed long, curving roads through the dark pine forests, illuminated by cold sunlight reflected off the moon. He had a lot on his mind, since he was not only recently married, but he had a four year old daughter to take care of.\n\nThe thought of not being able to provide for his toddler weighted down his head, and his eyes stayed focused on the ground. Though his mind drifted between thoughts and worries, the cold kept his body rigid and alert. The ethereal night seemed to not even faze the young man, content on going home. He was far enough away from town now to see the stars, but he'd never get far enough away to see the explosive beauty of the unpolluted night sky.\n\nAt last he arrived at his home. Though his mind remained inactive, his body reached into his suede jacket and removed the keys within, turning the lock without issue. He stumbled inside, leaving his shoes and his mind by the door. His hands curled around his neck and tugged on his red tie until it came loose, and then they loosed their grip until it fell to the ground. His body dropped into bed, and his mind joined it, without even worrying about bathing. The heat of his loved one warmed his frozen muscles, and he fell joyously into the arms of sleep.\n\nHe emerged from rest at 10 o clock AM. It was a Saturday now. The young man, reinvigorated, quickly bathed and put on new clothes. The heat of the water nearly lulled him back to sleep, but the sudden rush of cold he experienced after his shower brought him back out. The nervous young man carried his lazy bones into the kitchen, where they were greeted by the aroma of pancakes and bacon. His love, bless her soul, had prepared breakfast for them. The whole family gathered around the table and enjoyed a meal. At one point, the young girl noticed her father's glass was empty. \"You're glass went empty, daddy,\" she mumbled with an innocent smile on her face that only toddlers can have \"would you like another one?\" Her father grew a massive grin \"Why would I want two empty glasses?\"",

The potato, being made entirely of starch, didn't get drunk at all, let alone tipsy. The lemon, being citrus, didn't feel very good after the second drink. The pea, being very small, got absolutely trashed after the first drink.\n\nBeing the adult of the group, potato decided it was time to head home. When they all left the bar, lemon thought that they had been drinking too much so they shouldn't be driving home. Pea suggested that since they are all relatively circular in shape, they can just roll home. Potato and lemon thought it would be a good idea, so they all rolled down a hill towards their homes.\n\nPotato was bumping and flailing everywhere due to his abnormal shape. Lemon was also bumping and flailing everywhere because he wasn't perfectly circular either. Pea, however, was having the time of his life. Once they all landed at the bottom of the hill, potato was feeling exhausted, lemon was almost puking, and pea was jumping with joy, screaming \"Let's do that again! Let's do that again!\" Potato, who had some sense left, scolded pea saying \"Easy Pea-sy, Lemon's queasy!\"",

And no, he didn't write it, but he told it in his own way that I couldn't have come close to duplicating. I love you all and I look forward to making more jokes. Thank you.*",

Looking up at the priest, God says \"I'm satisfied with how you've lived and how you've spent your life. I give you the option to choose — Hell or heaven?\"\n\nThe priest is surprised. 'Who in their right minds would ever *choose* hell?'\nConfidently, he says \"Heaven, my master.\"\n\nGod nods. Instantly the priest is sent to the Heaven.\n\nThe priest looks around and finds a single, modest house. There's a tiny garden nearby and a few animals graze in it silently. The priest, having lived a life of modesty, settles quickly into the life. For lunch, he's given bread and butter. For dinner, he's given bread and butter.\n\nThe next day, he finds bread and butter for breakfast. He wonders, 'Maybe this is temporary.'\n\nFinding a tiny hole in the wall, he walks to it and peeps into what the status is in Hell. He's shocked at what he sees.\n\nA full banquet has been laid. People eat all kinds of fruits and sandwiches. They're drinking merrily and laughing. It doesn't look like Hell at all, for the priest had imagined Satan burning the men and women at stakes and laughing devilishly.\n\nDissapointed at the Lord's ways, but accepting them nevertheless he goes back to his hut.\n\nFor an entire week, he endures bread and butter. The silence around his hut suffocates him. Unable to sustain it anymore, he walks to the Lord.\n\n\"Why, if I've chosen Heaven, am I treated so badly? Where is my banquet and my half of fun? Is my service all in vain? Why do I have to eat the bread and butter every day?\" he laments.\n\nGod looks at the priest as if he has missed the obvious and says, \"Well, we're not going to keep the kitchen busy and running just for one person, right?!\"",

The doctor pours it in the top of a complex analysis unit and a short time later, it spits out a tape reading.\nDoctor looks at it and says, “ you have tennis elbow”.\n“That’s ridiculous” he says’ “I don’t play tennis!”\nDoctor informs him it’s just a term for tendinitis in the elbow and sends him home with instructions not to overuse his arm and return in two weeks.\n\nThe guy returns two weeks later and the process is repeated. The doctor sends him home with the same instructions.\n\nAfter several visits like this the guy is certain the doctor is just racking up billable hours, so before he goes to his next appointment he; has his wife pee in a can; his daughter pee in a can, catches his dogs pee in a can; puts some used oil from his car in the can and, for good measure; jacks off in it. He then hides it in the men’s room before the nurse takes him back to the examining room.  \n\nWhen the doc hands him the sample cup, he doesn’t question it and goes to the men’s room, pees in the cup and adds some of his stash to it, returning it to the doctor who blindly pours it in.\n\nThe unit goes freakin nuts; smoking, whirring, lights flashing, alarms going off-so the doctor asks him to have a seat in the waiting room.\n\nAn hour later the guy is called back, a smirk on his face and the doctor pulls out a two-foot long printout and reads the diagnoses: your wife, Sarah, has syphilis; your daughter, Tina, is pregnant; your dog, Jack, has cancer; your 2016 BMW is low on oil..............and if you don’t quit whacking off you’ll *never* get rid of that tennis elbow!",

Do you have any recommendations for a pet to keep me company?”\n\nThe sales rep says “What about a dog?”\n\n“No no no, I’ve already had a dog and they’re a lot of work to clean up after”\n\n“Well what about a cat? They’re low maintenance..”\n\nThe woman replies “No thank you, all that hair to clean up? And the litter to scoop?”\n\nThe representative thinks for a while and says “I have the perfect idea in mind for you. We just got a chimpanzee in and he can do it all, he can even help with chores around the house.”\n\nThe woman seems taken aback in disbelief, but the pet store worker assures her that he’s 100% serious. “Look, there’s a grocery right next door. Why don’t you take him grocery shopping and give him your list?”\n\nThe woman reluctantly agrees and takes the chimpanzee with her to do her grocery shopping. Sure enough, the chimpanzee went through the whole store and got every single item on the list, and even faster than the widow would have done. The widows returns to the pet store and says “You weren’t kidding! I’ll take him.”  \n\nThe excited widow had an event to go to that evening, but was so impressed with the chimpanzee that she decided to take him along to the event including the bus ride there and back. \n\nOn the way back from the event there was a horrible accident involving the bus and every person died except the chimpanzee. The police are so impressed at the chimpanzee’s ability to communicate they start to interview him about the accident.\n\nOne of the officers sits down to interview the chimpanzee and asks “At the time of the accident, what was everyone doing?”\n\nThe chimpanzee gives it some thought and places his hand on his stomach and wiggles his hips back and forth.\n\n“They were dancing??” asks the wide-eyed officer.\n\nThe chimpanzee confidently nods repeatedly.\n\n“Well were they doing anything else?\n\nThe chimpanzee thinks and mimes drinking out of a cup.\n\n“They were drinking?!” exclaims the officer.\n\nThe chimpanzees assuredly nods back to the officer.\n\nThe cop is completely taken aback by their behavior and asks “Well, while they were all doing this what were YOU doing?”\n\nRaises his hands up and wiggles them like he’s driving the bus.",

The Rabbi protests and says \"Wait, that's it, we're not even gonna talk about this?\" So the Pope asks what he wants to do and the Rabbi says that he wants to have a debate the following week. The Pope agrees and they part ways.\n\nA few days before the debate, the Pope realizes that he's just agreed to debate with a Jew. He realizes that he needs to level the playing field a bit, so he calls the Rabbi.\n\nPope: \"The way I see it, you challenged me to a duel. So, I get to pick the weapons.\"\n\nRabbi: \"Okay, what are the weapons?\"\n\nPope: \"We can't use words.\"\n\nRabbi: \"Well then how are we going to debate?\"\n\nPope: \"We'll figure that out.\"\n\nSo the day comes when the debate is set. The Pope and the Rabbi sit down with each other. Everyone is silent and watches the two as they begin silently debating.\n\nPope: \\*Holds up three fingers\\*\n\nRabbi: \\*Holds up one finger\\*\n\nPope: \\*Crosses himself\\*\n\nRabbi: \\*Points at the ground\\*\n\nPope: \\*Takes out a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread from his robes\\*\n\nRabbi: \\*Takes an apple out of his robes\\*\n\nTo everyone's astonishment, the Pope then declares to all present that the Rabbi has won and the Jews would be permitted to stay in Rome. Upon returning to the Vatican later that evening, a bishop asks the Pope what happened. The Pope replies:\n\n\"We started and I said that there was the Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He said that we all pray to one God. I replied that God sent His son to do His work. He said that we were all here to do God's work. So then, I showed him the body and blood of Christ. He showed me an apple and said that we were all children of the Original Sin. I couldn't argue with that, so he won.\"\n\nAcross town, the Rabbi gets home and his wife asks him what happened. The Rabbi replies:\n\n\"I should know what happened? That son of a bitch gets in there and he says we got three days to get out! So I tell him that ain't one Jew gonna leave this town. And then he says that's he's gonna get us out if he has to rope us up and drag us out, so I say well I'm not leaving this spot! So then, he pulls out his lunch, I pull out mine, and then he tells me I win!\"",

If you ask her to marry you, and she says no, then your penis will shrink 10 centimeters.\n\nThe man has nothing to lose and decides to give it a shot. He goes to the forest, walks down a small path and finds the old ladies home. He rings the bell, she opens up and the man asks: \"will you marry me?\"\n\n\"No\", says the old lady, and she closes the door.\n\nThe man walks back home, measures his penis and he is amazed. 40 centimeters!\n\nHe still thinks his penis is too big, and the next day, he follows visits the old lady again. He knocks on the door and she opens the door. \"will you marry me?\" he asks politely. \n\n\"No!\" the old lady screams. She slams the door and the man goes back home.\n\n30 centimeters! Just one more time, the man thinks to himself. Then it will be the perfect size.\n\nThe next day he rings the doorbell again. The old lady opens up.\n\n\"Will you marry me?\" he asks. \n\nThe old lady gets mad and yells: \"No! No! And for the last time: NO!\"",

When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.\n\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.\n\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cleveland Browns whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.",

As I was walking along I stubbed my toe. I looked down to see what it was and it was a really old kettle looking thing. I picked it up and as I was dusting sand off of it there was a flash of blinding white light and out popped... a genie! I was in shock! Anyway, he said in an incredibly loud voice “YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM A 10,000 YEAR IMPRISONMENT! YOU HAVE 3 WISHES!”\nSo I said “yeah sure. My first wish is to be stupidly rich.” And all of a sudden there were grills on my teeth, rings on my fingers and I had AirPods in my ears! It was fabulous! So I said “Wow! My second wish is to be married to the most beautiful and lovely woman in the world!” And suddenly I got a tap on the shoulder. I turned around to see who it was, and it was the most beautiful, kind looking woman looking at me lovingly. It was great! And so, and you might agree that this is where I went wrong... my third wish was “I want a big orange head.”\n\nHarry then left the bar, wondering why this had happened to him.",

    "selftext": "Joyce is one of them.. Very hot, around 30-35 years old. When I'm chatting with her, I lose all sense of time.\n\nOne day she tells me \"My husband's going out of town on business this Sunday. Why don't you come over? I'll be alone in the house :-)\"\n\n\"What if he comes back while I'm there?\" I ask.\n\n\"Oh he won't, don't worry.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but what if he does?\" (I'm not the one to take any stupid chances at my age.)\n\n\"I'm sure he won't, but if he does, you just start cleaning the windows. I'll tell him you're from the cleaning company. Anyways he keeps complaining about how his mom keeps their house cleaner than I ever could. I'll just tell him it was meant to be a surprise for him. He won't suspect a thing.\"\n\nIt sounds like a brilliant plan! I tell myself \"Man! She's not only smoking hot, she's also smart!... and she wants ME!\"\n\nSo, I show up next Sunday and just my luck, the dude comes back within minutes, saying his client cancelled on him. I silently thank her for suggesting an easy way out in advance and immediately get to cleaning the windows. Seeing him giving inquisitive glances towards me, Joyce comes to my rescue. Explains how she wanted to surprise him with a sparkling house. \n\nHe starts complaining (like she had told me already) how she's useless and now she's wasting money hiring a cleaning company. She says there was a promotion going on and she apparently got a great deal. Man! The woman can think on her feet!\n\nHe finally calmed down, and gets on my case. Micromanaging every bit of the cleaning. Gets me to clean their windows, do the dishes, clean the kitchen, garage, attic… makes me mop, vacuum, do the laundry. I didn't complain once. In fact to make it look more convincing I put in some extra effort. A lot of extra effort.\n\nFinally after six hours of back-breaking work, (the house was filthy by the way) it seems there's nothing left to clean. He calls out to Joyce and asks how much he needs to pay me. She says she's already paid in advance to my office. So the husband tips me a twenty. I thank him and leave. Quietly thanking my luck.. Man what a close save!\n\nJoyce has blocked me on Facebook since the incident. I think it's a smart move, why take another risk?",

She was very intrigued by him, as she had never been with a fighter pilot before. Soon enough, her emotions got the best of her, and she exclaimed \"Kiss me, Jacques!\" So he grabs the bottle of red wine- splashes it on her lips, and gives her a passionate kiss. Although she liked the kiss, the woman asks \"why did you splash red wine on my lips?\" He responds, \"I am Jacques Pierre, the French fighter pilot. And I always have red wine with red meat.\"\n\nIntrigued, the woman decides to move things along. After a few minutes of passionate kissing, she says to Jacques \"Go lower.\" So he rips open her blouse, grabs the bottle of white wine- splashes it on her chest, and then sucks it off her breasts. The woman asks \"why did you splash white wine on my chest?\" He responds, \"I am Jacques Pierre, the French fighter pilot. And I always have white wine with white meat.\"\n\nSo she lets things continue as they have; and after a few more minutes she says \"Go lower.\" So he rips off her panties, pours Cognac all over her crotch, then lights it on fire. The woman jumps up screaming, \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!?!\" \n\nHe calmly replies, \"I am Jacques Pierre, the French fighter pilot. And when I go down, I go down in flames.\"",

There is no crew as dedicated or skilled as you, the crew of the USS Placentia!  We have all been together now for several years and for many of you this is your second or third posting to this fine vessel!  As many of you know, the US Navy has been using us as an experiment to see how a crew of actual brothers will work together.  Our ship named after Placentia California embodies the idea that family ties make us stronger!   I'm proud to be your commander and to look out upon all the fine families we have aboard!\n\nAs I look out at you I see the Smith brothers who've all served multiple times on Placentia.   I see the Castillo twins, also veterans of our fine ship.  Of course who could forget the Joke brothers who live up to their family name and keep us entertained out  under the sea, all 3 of whom have served with us in the past!\"\n\nAs the Capitain began to finish his speech the Executive Officer leaned over and whispered in his ear.  He turned back to the mic and spoke again, \"Men! I owe you an apology as I misspoke.  It seems we have someone new in our crew this time around and I'm happy to say it's the 4th and youngest of the Joke brothers!  Yes, Gentlemen, we finally have a Joke that's not a repost in this sub!\"",

He tells the inspector that he will receive a bonus if he can find the cause of the problem and report back within 3 days.\n\nThe inspector goes to the shipping and distribution warehouse on the first day but finds they are efficiently packing and shipping the factory goods but dont have enough to fill all the orders.\n\nThe inspector heads to the factory for the second day only to discover it is really well run but they lack the supply of ingredients to fully utilize the factory.\n\nOn the third day he goes to the farms and finds that while they are planting enough tomatoes that half the fields are poorly irrigated causing smaller yields.\n\nHe races to the nearest telegraph office to report his findings before the end of the day only to be told that he must pay 10 cents per word. He quickly checks his wallet and pockets to find he forgot to go to the bank recently and only had a quarter and nickel in his pocket.\n\nThinking quickly he sends off his 3 word telegraph to the CEO.\n\nHeinz vines dry",

I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance.”\n\n“They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation.

One last point: “No Jews, please.” \"\n\nSending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied: “Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending four of my best and most prized officers.”\n\n“One is a Lieutenant Commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.”\n\n“The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD, in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.”\n\n“The third officer is also a Lieutenant, with degrees in both computer systems and information technology from SMU and he is awaiting notification on his Doctoral Dissertation from Cal Tech.”\n\n“Finally, the fourth officer, also a Lieutenant Commander, is our ship’s doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina. We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .”\n\nUpon receiving this letter, Melinda’s mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).\n\nAt precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda’s mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling Black officers.\n\nHer mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, “There must be some mistake.”\n\n“No, Madam,” said the first officer.\n\n“Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes.”",

I want nothing more than to fufill my destiny and be cashed in!\" The Rabbi looks at him and says \"I'm sorry but the best I can do is put you in our drawer and wait until you're needed\"\n\nThe coupon is frustrated and leaves. Down the road he comes upon a church. A priest asks him\" Little coupon, you seem in despair, may I help you?\" The coupon says:\" I am a coupon and I just went to a synagogue where the Rabbi said he couldn't help me with completing my life goal of being cashed in.\"\nThe Priest answers: \"My son, you have come to the right place. Because Jews save but Jesus redeems.\"",

    "title": "A story about a man named Yuri",
    "selftext": "There once was a man named Yuri.\n\nYuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.\n\nEvery day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, \"SWIMMING LESSONS\" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.\n\nYuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, \"If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough...\" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.\n\nEvery day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.\n\nA few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.\n\nLater that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words \"DIVING PRACTICES\" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.\n\nThe practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.\n\nMany people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. \"It is only something I am fond of, a hobby\" Yuri would say. \"I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy.\" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.\n\nFor yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. \"TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!\" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.\n\nFinally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. \"It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life...\" Yuri would always respond to his fans.\n\nOne day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. \"Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!\" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, \"And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!\" Yuri replied, \"Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.\"\n\nYuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.\n\nUnfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. \"Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!\" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.\n\n\"It is OK, everybody\" Yuri yelled back. \"I have endured many hardships in my life.\"",

They walk up the pink side walk, up to the pink door and rings the pink doorbell. \nA man opens the pink door. He is wearing pink overalls, pink undershirt, pink shoes with pink socks, he has pink hair and is skin tone is a kind of pinkish color. The business men ask if they could stay the night because there is no place else in sight. The pink man says yes and leads them in. \nThe walls are pink, the furniture is pink and the hallway is pink. The pink man tells the business men that they can use the bedroom upstairs. \nSo they goes up the pink stairs down to the pink door and into the pink room, where the beds are pink the nightstands are pink and windows are a pinkish color. \nIn the morning they go to the pink dining room and the pink man asks if they want Cheerios or Raisin Bran. The first asks for Cheerios. The second asks for Cheerios. The third asks for Raisin Bran. They all eat then leave. \nA few years later the pink man dies. The business men hearing about what had happened are very sad and goes to his pink funeral. They all wear pink and pray that he rests in peace. \nThe point of the story is that 2 out of 3 people prefer Cheerios over Raisin Bran.\n\nEdit: For the people who don’t get it. It’s supposed to waste your time. A big build up to something stupid.",

    "selftext": " Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a mans' penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. \n\nAfter the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study was incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. \n\nWhen the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didnt really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.  \n\n\n\\[not my joke, but to good not to share\\]",

When she brought them home, little Adolf saw them and asked, \"Mama, can Ich try a cookie?\" But Mrs. Hitler said, \"No Adolf, you cannot eat a cookie. We will have dinner soon, and Ich dont want you to spoil your appetite. You can have one after you eat.\" Then she put the cookies in the cookie jar on the top shelf in the kitchen. Adolf was short and couldn't reach the jar, and he wanted the cookies now. He grabbed the crate they kept onions in, turned it upside down, and stood on it, but he still couldn't reach it. He had a new idea. Adolf went over to the chair and dragged it over to the shelf and climbed on. But alas, he was still to short. He began to give up hope, and struggled to come up with any more ideas. But then he had the final solution! He went to the shed, grabbed his father's ladder, and brought it inside. Setting it beside the shelf, he climbed up to where he was right beside the cookie jar, and got his cookies on the third reich.",

I'm very tired.\" She snorted, \"Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!\" This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window and sat down.\n\nThe woman shrieked, \"Someone must defend my honor! Put this American in his place!\" An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up.  \n\"Sir, you Americans seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You hold the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you seem to have thrown the wrong bitch out the window.\"",

    "selftext": "The Trids were a happy folk, mostly due to their vast riches. They weren't known for being warriors, or for being artists, or for their architecture, but simply because they had the most gold, an entire mountain of it infact. But one day the powerful dragon, Sorial, swooped down on Gennemill and overtook the mountain. With Sorial sitting atop all of the gold, the Trids were unable to access their riches. \n\nThe Trids tried everything: catapults, to hurt the dragon - didn't work. Digging through the bottom of the mountain, they weren't strong enough. Peaceful conversations? No go. They realized this dragon would not go down without a fight. \n\nFor 15 years, the Trids trained every child born to be great warriors, similar to that of Sparta. Many died trying to become great warriors leaving only the strongest and bravest Trids for the army. Finally, they were confident, that one of these warriors could slay the Dragon. \n\nThey first sent the fifth best warrior - Marcedius. So Marcedius climbed the mountain, camping for 3 nights before making it to the top. He finally reached the dragon, tired and sore and he brandished his sword. Sorial took one look, stood up and kicked Marcedius down the mountain to his death. \n\nThe 4th best warrior, Bolognaius, climbed the mountain in two nights. He reached the dragon with more energy than Marcedius, confident he could win. He brandished his hammer and took a mighty seong, bopping the dragon on his big toe. Unphased, Sorial kicked Bolognauis down the mountain to his death. \n\nThe third best warrior, was know for his archery. His name was Legotrid. He climbed to his firing point in one night, significantly further from Sorial. He shot an arrow into the mountain heights above and heard a loud screech. Confident his arrow struck Sorial dead, he climbed the mountain to regain control of the gold. The fool to his surprise, came to an angry and fully awake Dragon, who promptly kicked him down the mountain to his demise. \n\nThe 2nd best warrior, was the largest of all Trids. His name was Gigante McSmante Stringer Bell. He climbed the mountain in only 10 hours, swiftly and calculated being sure to be extra quiet. He snuck up behind the dragon, whom was asleep, and climbed to the top of his head. He pulled out a slim dagger and raised his hands to the sky. Sorial then farted himself awake, knocking Gigante McSmante Stringer Bell to the ground at his feet. Realizing the threat, dragon kicked the trid down the mountain and all the way to West Baltimore. \n\nThe Trids best warrior, was no warrior, but the calm and wise great Rabbi. The Trids were very religious, and their Rabbi was no easy fight. With his wisdom he was able to best even the greatest minds, once beating Bobby Fischer in a game of chess blindfolded. So the Rabbi climbed the mountain, in one week, conserving his energy for this mental bout with Sorial. He finally made it atop the mountain, no dragon in sight. He waltzed into the mountain packed up the gold and brought it down the mountain day after day until it was all gone.\n\n Very confused, he returned to the top of the mountain seeking out the Dragon. He found Sorial, perched at the top completely unwilling to fight. He asked the Dragon, \"Sorial, why didn't you kick me down the mountain?\" And Sorial, whom first belched a flaming burp, said calmly to him \"Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"",

Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. \n\nThe man goes to the bus driver and asks him if he knows of a way for him to have sex with the nun. \"Well,\" says the bus driver, \"every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If you dress up as God, I'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you.\" \n\nThe man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. \"Oh, God!\" she exclaims. \"Take me with you!\" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. Before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off his God disguise. \"Ha, ha!\" he says, \"I'm the man from the bus!\" \n\n\"Ha, ha!\" says the nun, removing her costume, \"I'm the bus driver!\"",

    "selftext": " There was once a boy. He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,\n\n\"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?\"\n\nHis son replied.\n\n\"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.\"\n\nHis father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.\n\n\"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?\"\n\n\"Okay son, go ahead.\"\n\nThe boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.\n\nOn the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.\n\n\"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"\n\nHis son replied.\n\n\"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nHis father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.\n\n\"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nThe father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.\n\nOn the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.\n\n\"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"\n\n\"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.\"\n\nNow, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.\n\n\"My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nHis son replied.\n\n\"My father. Please humor me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.\"\n\nHis father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.\n\n\"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nThe father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.\n\nThe day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.\n\n\"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"\n\n\"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was very confused by this and had to ask again.\n\n\"My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nHis son replied.\n\n\"My father. Please humor me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.\"\n\nHis father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.\n\n\"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nNow the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.\n\nNow, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.\n\n\"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"\n\nThe boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.\n\n\"My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...\"\n\nHis father replied.\n\n\"My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?\"\n\n\"Alright father. Come closer.\"\n\nHis father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentence.\n\n\"The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is I ate it\"\n\nAnd then he died.",

I scrolled for days and days but never got bored. Then I came to know that we can ask about many things you want to find.\n\nThe first thing that clicked my mind was that show. So I made a post asking about Where can I find the OST of that show. I got many answers like YT, Spotify but I had searched every place and that music was nowhere. I was desperate to find that music as I know my days are near.\n\nThen after many moons, I got a notification on that post. With a surprise I read that comment. It was of a girl. That comment told me to search for that music on r/Jokes. I was amazed. Why on earth r/Jokes started giving OSTs and songs and music. I asked her for the reason.\n\nShe replied,\" look sir, the only place where you can find your music is r/Jokes because r/Jokes is full of 'Rep' OSTs.",

Is Dickinson a family name?”\n\nThe Englishwoman grimaced. “No, that one’s a job title.”",

    "title": "In the Empire of China, under the reign of Emperor Taizong...",
    "selftext": "In the Empire of China, under the reign of Emperor Taizong, a young courtier resided in the noble palace. This courtier, in particular, was known to be considerably disliked by the rest of the court, on account of rumors about the true nature of his parentage (it was alleged that his mother had been impregnated by a base commoner who had been able to slip past the guards of his father's manor house). While they would never stoop to an assassination attempt, the nobles generally agreed that the boy was an embarrassment, and that something must be done to remove him from the court to spare the Emperor from his unsightly existence.  \n\n\nOne of the higher-ranking nobles was able to catch the Emperor's ear, and suggested to his Heavenly Majesty that it might be advisable for the king to map out some of his southern provinces in greater detail, and that a trusted advisor should accomplish the work- someone like young Lu Zhishen, who had served the Emperor well and was likely suited to such a task. The Emperor agreed to this, and before long Lu Zhishen was forced to pack his bags and set out to the South.  \n\n\nLu Zhishen first stopped in a village named Shānjiǎo, which means Mountain Foot. The beds there were rough, the people spoke in an uncouth manner, and there was little to no of the luxury he had become accustomed to. As his retainers bargained for supplies and scouted out the local woods. Lu Zhishen felt a restlessness creep over him, and resolved to inspect the village himself, to determine anything of interest that might befit the attention of the Emperor. He left his room, and, upon surveying the village for a few minutes, noted a few strange anomalies. Firstly, there were no young men of his age. There were boys, older men, and the elderly, and girls of every age, but it seemed as if all the young men between twenty and thirty summers of age had mysteriously vanished. Secondly, as he inspected the tall mountain range for which the village was named, he noted a strange red shape high up along the winding path through the mountains.  \n\n\nPulling aside an old man, he interrogated him for answers.  \n\"Old man, what is up on that mountain, and why can I find no young men within this village?\"  \nThe old man smiled his toothy grin, and replied thus:  \n\"Upon that mountain is the temple of the Buddha. Once the young men here reach twenty years of age, they are required to climb that mountain and spend ten years in the temple along with the other monks there.\"  \n\"Ten years!\" Lu Zhishen exclaimed. \"And what do they accomplish while they are up there? Do they debate, or read scripture?\"  \nThe old man shook his head. \"They meditate, in utter silence. Once a man steps foot through the gateway of the temple, he must not speak another word until a decade has passed.\"  \n\n\nStunned and fascinated by this, Lu Zhishen returned to his quarters, where he took a meager meal and rested until the morning. When he woke up, he left the inn only to find that the town was nearly empty, devoid of any inhabitants. Returning to the innkeeper, he inquired about this.  \n\"They are likely waiting out in their fields,\" the innkeeper replied. \"It is the harvest day- the day of the reaping.\"  \n\"Waiting?\" Lu Zhishen replied. \"There are only so many hours in the day to work- whatever are they waiting for?\"  \n\"The monks,\" the innkeeper replied. \"It is customary for the monks to begin the reaping.\"  \n\n\nLu Zhishen walked to the fields, and sure enough watched as a chain of orange-clothed monks descended down the mountain. Meanwhile, the farmers all stood idle in their fields, watching the group slowly descend. All this was quite irritating to Lu Zhishen, but he kept quiet as the ritual proceeded. Finally, the monks arrived, each carrying boxes from which emanated a delicious smell. All at once, the monks stood at attention, and with the ringing of a bell from the center monk (who Lu Zhishen determined to be an abbot or leader of some kind), all of them shouted \"Time to harvest!\"  \nAll at once, all of the farmers sprung to work- some cutting their fields, others sampling the food the monks had brought. Meanwhile, the monks broke into fevered discussion- amongst themselves, and to the farmers. This confused Lu Zhishen greatly, and so he turned to a nearby farmer.  \n\"Doesn't it break their vows to shout and speak like that?\"  \nThe farmer shrugged. \"You'd think so, but apparently not. The abbot only permits speech now, and only he knows why. You could've asked the old abbot, but unfortunately, he died a month ago.\"  \n\n\nThe next day, Lu Zhishen set off on his journey to map the rest of the South. He encountered many more adventures, most of which are too long and too complex to be fully detailed here. There were many things that seemed strange or obscure, but none so much as that peculiar farming ritual he had observed his first week in Shānjiǎo. He puzzled it over in his head for months on end, but could never come to a conclusion as to why such a flagrant violation would be allowed under the laws of the monastery.  \n\n\nA year after he left, Lu Zhishen once more returned to Shānjiǎo, once more upon the day of the reap. Once more, the monks descended from the mountain, and once more the same peculiar ritual was observed. Lu Zhishen refrained from interacting this time, instead doing his best to guess at the intentions of the abbot. After the reaping, he rushed to the abbot's side and begged him to explain this contradiction, but the abbot only smiled and touched his lips, bound to silence as they all were.  \n\n\nLu Zhishen rode for seven more years, growing into a man. After years of arduous labor, he completed his map of the south, and began to ride north, on the verge of fulfilling his promise to the emperor. All thoughts of the monks and their strange ritual escaped from his mind, until, one day, as he rode through Shānjiǎo, he was accosted by an old man.  \n\"Lu Zhishen!\" yelled the man. \"It's me- the farmer you spoke to! The old abbot has retired! Now's your chance to ask him!\"  \n\n\nIntrigued, Lu Zhishen immediately tied up his horse and went to the old abbot's cottage, where the same man he'd tried to speak to seven years earlier now sat, slowly drinking a pot of stew. Lu Zhishen bowed heavily.  \n\"Grandfather,\" he said. \"I have seen your rituals, but there is one question that has always eluded me: why do you allow your monks to speak on the days of the reaping?\"  \nThe old man smiled, and gave this simple answer: \"My son, to be a good host, one must engage their guests in conversation. And as any scholar of the Buddha would tell you, reap hosting is an excellent way to accumulate Karma.\"",

The mouse is looking at the fly and is thinking you know what: that fly drops six inches, that fish gets that fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops his sandwich and shoots the bear, i'm gonna jump on that sandwich, and i'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.    \n\nWhat the mouse didn't realize was that there was a cat watching the mouse, watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. That cat sitting there looking at that fly and it's like you know what: that fly drops six inches, that fish gets that fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops his sandwich, he shoots the bear, the mouse gets the sandwich, i'm gonna get that mouse and i'm gonna have a really nice meal.  \n\nAnd then, all of a sudden it all happened. The fly drops six inches, the fish got the fly, the bear got the fish, the hunter threw down his sandwich and shot the bear, the mouse jumped on the sandwich but then it all went wrong…   \n\nThe cat went to jump on the mouse and missed and landed in the river, got completely soaked. And i think that's something to be said for or something in life. No matter where you are what you are what you're doing. When a fly drops six inches a pussy is gonna get wet…",

So next thing you know the man is at the craps table with his whole life savings in front of him, he looks at the frog in his pocket. \"Ribbit, black 8\", it croaked. Suddenly the man is a millionaire and buys the best penthouse in the hotel. He jumps into bed with extreme joy and says, \"Wow Lucky frog, you've changed my life. How can I ever repay you?\" \"Ribbit, kiss me\" says the lucky frog. Sure he thought, So the man kissed the frog and it magically turned into a beautiful, volumptous, blonde, 16 year old girl.\n\n \"AND THAT YOUR HONOR IS HOW SHE GOT INTO MY ROOM!\"",

    "selftext": "In the beauty industry, as in most industry, there are a number of niches that owners choose to specialize in for the sake of marketing — Asian massage, ridiculously long acrylic nails, wrapping rich white ladies in sea grass— you get the picture.  \n\nJennifer’s spa is truly a shithole.  She has no niche, she has few skills, and most importantly, she has no customers.  Looking to re-invent her spa’s image and boost profits, Jennifer attends a convention that attends to specialization and education within the aesthetics industry... a Spa Niche convention of sorts.\n\nThere, she meets a fabulously wealthy spa owner Named Esmerelda.  Esmerelda is dripping in gold, diamonds, and high-end designer clothing.  Eager to discover Esmerelda’s secret to success and emulate it, Jennifer pumps her for information, only to discover that building a successful business took Esmerelda years of blood, sweat and tears.  Esmerelda recommends Jennifer attend additional education and broaden her skill-set.... a course of action that Jennifer doesn’t exactly have the time or cash to peruse.   Jennifer decides “what the heck” — why not just kill this bitch, steal whatever wealth she had on her (look at the size of those diamonds!), and dump the spa business all together.  \n\nJennifer becomes Esmerelda’s best pal at the convention.  They go for a walk outside during lunch hour, but Jennifer does not act. She finds herself alone with Esmerelda in the bathroom, but she still does not act.  Finally, the day is nearing the end, and Jennifer brazenly attacks Esmerelda in the middle of the final Question and Answer panel of the convention.  Predictably, Esmerelda survives, and Jennifer finds herself in police questioning promptly.\n\n“What I don’t understand” questioned the detective, “is why you didn’t act sooner.  We reviewed the camera footage, and you had Esmerelda alone both outside and in the bathroom— why in the world would you choose a question and answer panel with a full audience to make your move?”\n\n“Well,” explained Jennifer, “I truly thought that nobody ever suspects the Spa-Niche Inquisition”",

Could you tell me how is your Wolkswagen so fast?\" To which she replies \"Oh, dear, my car has a special engine, and everytime you say 'fuck', it goes 100mph faster.\" The guy is very impressed with this and proposes a deal to the woman where they switch cars. The woman, having always wanted to try a Ferrari, agrees, and they switch keys. \n\nThe guy climbs into the Wolkswagen and yells \"FUCK FUCK\" and the car blasts off, 200mph, down the highway. The guy is loving it, until he realizes! A mile down the road a cop is standing, stopping traffic. The guy slams the breaks, and the car starts skidding, tires screeching, and stops just a mere inches away from the cop.\n\nSweating, the cop exclaims \"Fuck me, I thought it wouldn't stop!\"",

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.\n\nI've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.\n\nBut it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.\n\nStacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.\n\nIn the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!\n\nDon't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.\n\nLove, your son, Joshua.\n\nP.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!",

He decided to wait in that line just to get his tuxedo. He then went to the shoe store to get him some fancy shoes for prom. Of course there was an extremely long line at the shoe store and once again he decided to wait in the line to buy his shoes. Next, the guy went to a special flower store to buy himself a boutonnière to put on his tuxedo. There was an extremely long line and of course he waited in that line. After those few things he had to go to a limousine dealer to rent a limousine and of course there was an extremely long line! He waited in the line and finally got his limousine. Prom day arrived and the guy had to polish his shoes so he went to a little place down the road that is skilled at polishing shoes and there was once again an extremely long line. He waited in that line and finally got his shoes polished. The guy and his prom date finally arrived at the prom and went inside. The guys date asked him to get her some punch and since he was a nice guy he went to where the punch was and saw that there was no punchline. Good thing his prom time wouldn’t be wasted by waiting in a line.",

A small tingling. He looked down to see hew was covered in hair from the waist down and most strangely of all, he had hooves. These new legs of his forced him to naturally bend over. He found this fall to be gracefully cushioned by another pair of hooves on his newly hairy arms. Then suddenly his vision had become so impaired he could see for more of what was beside him than what was in front of him. Then after bursting out of all of his clothes he realised... He had become a mule. After clocking this he blacked out. \n\nHe woke up in bed with his wife reassuringly stroking his human-like arm. She said \"Darling, you've been in bed all afternoon, are you alright?\".\n\nHe replied \"I'm mostly okay, I just felt a little hoarse\".",

How can you do it so cheap?\" the mafia boss asked.\n\n\"Oh that's easy,\" the chief rabbi answered \"we call at local rates\"",

But the very first night in the hotel, she made a call to the manager to request additional towels, and the call ended with \"Have a good night, Mr. Ita.\" Taking that as a sign that Canada was not the place for her, she booked a flight to leave early the next morning.\n\nSo she tried going to the United States, which had made some strides recently in LGBT rights. But let's be honest, the US is kind of a dumpster fire right now, what with the Nazis and such, so she moved on.\n\nFinally she flew to Cuba, just to sit on the beach and escape from everything. Everyone in Cuba was so kind, so accommodating, and addressed her respectfully. She even went out without any makeup, and still, everyone went out of their way to use her new pronouns. \n\nAfter two weeks, she contacted a local realtor and said she wanted to buy a house.\n\n\"Why would you want to stay here, when you could live anywhere in the world?\" asked the realtor. \n\n\"I love it when you call me señorita.\"",

The next day, the man went around town and saw all of his jokes on the ground, causing him to into fall into extreme depression, and for a while, he refused to leave his house.\n\nEventually, he managed to get back on his feet. While he was walking around, he noticed that the same joke was put back up in all of the usual spots. Later, a former criminal noticed the old man and introduced himself as the guy who replaced all of the posters.\n\nStunned at the revelation, the old man asked “Why would a person like you help me at one of the lowest points of my life?”\n\nTo which the ex-con replied “I think your joke is hilarious, and after not seeing it up for two days, I thought it would be good karma to repost it.”",

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.\n\nThe elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..\n\nThen suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.\n\nThe policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.\n\nAfter about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.\n\nThe policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.\n\nSo, as the couple passes, he says to them, \"Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?\"\n\nShaking, the old man is barely able to reply,\n\n\"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\"",

He tested with a banana and hurrah! it works. With the banana split in half, the king inserted the mechanism into her wife's genitals and waited.  \n\n\nHe went to a campaign for a year. Upon his return, he called all of his advisers and ordered them to derobe. Hesitant, they all did so, and to the king's amazement, they did not have their penises. Expect one. The king had ordered 99 advisers to be executed and exclaimed that the loyal adviser be given given gold, mansions and all the pleasures and riches under the sun. The conquered lands. Since he no longer wanted his wife and she did not bore him a son, he even made him the heir to his kingdom!  \n\n\nThough all this, the adviser was quite, so the king asked him ,\"so what do you think of it all?\"  \n\n\nThe adviser could only mumble... as he did not have his tongue.",

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  \n\n\nWhen the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, \"Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backward.\"  \n\n\nHe listened a while longer, and said, \"There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backward, too. Most puzzling.\" So the magistrate kept listening; \"There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...\"  \n\n\nSuddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, \"My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.\"",

They ran several tests, asking him to hold the hands of several people and state their ethnicity. He did so, as he always had, with barely a hesitation.\n\nThen they decided to trick him. They brought in his wife Nguyet, his friend Wong, and his dentist Edgar. All three entered the room silently.\n\nThe head researcher beckoned Wong over, and had him position himself in the same way all other tested people had been - but the researcher himself took Nguyen's hand.\n\n\"This person is European,\" Nguyen said immediately.\n\nThe researcher nodded to Wong, who said, \"No Nguyen, it's me.\"\n\nNguyen heard Wong's voice from exactly where he would expect it. But he knew that he was holding a white man's hand, and Wong was Chinese.\n\n\"This is not your hand, Wong. This is a white man's hand.\"\n\n\"That is Wong's hand, Nguyen. Have we been going too long? Do you need a break?\" The head researcher was impressed, but knew that he had to be absolutely certain about Nguyen's abilities.\n\nNguyen held firm. He shook his head strongly.\n\n\"If this is Wong, why does it feel so white?\"",

On and on they trudge, as all the oases they pass crumble into more dunes of sand to their despair.\n\nIn the distance, the guide spots a grand tree, bigger than any sand dune. As they approach, the guide grows ecstatic. \"Look my friend, look! It's a bacon tree!\" proclaims the freshly enthused guide who has found a second wind, before half-running half-crawling to the tree. \n\n\"Ibrahim, wait!\" The crusader shouts as they are both suddenly peppered by arrows and knocked to the ground.\n\nWith his last breath, the crusader rasps \"Ibrahim, they caught us.

    "title": "A brilliant meteorology professor goes to Nebraska.",
    "selftext": "There was this brilliant meteorology professor who lived in Chicago. Every day was the same for him. He left his house at 8 AM every morning, went to the university, taught about the weather, then came home. OF course, he did go shopping and whatnot when needed, but that was the basis of most days. And he went to parties and played golf on occasion, but that was very rare. One day, his good friend invited him to Nebraska. The professor *was* pretty bored, so he considered it. After much deliberation, he made up his mind. In the most Russian accent he could muster, he said to himself, “I am going to Nebraska.” At 11 AM sharp the next day, he was to get on a flight to Nebraska. \n\nHe woke up more alive than normal. He brushed his teeth vigorously for the dentist-recommended 2 minutes, with his Oral-B toothbrush and Colgate toothpaste. He loved the artificial mint flavor of Colgate. He took a Lyft to the airport and got there in under 30 minutes. He handed out a generous 22% tip and headed inside the airport. He did all of his ticketings and went through security, where they confiscated his Colgate due to matters of NATIONAL SECURITY. And then he was off. Once on the plane, he noticed that he got the window seat. He said to himself, “Let me see outside.” He looked outside, and he saw that it was good. The pilot was exceptional; a virtuoso, even. It was a smooth flight until they got near Nebraska. Even this pilot could not avoid turbulence with the colossal, raging storm outside. Luckily, the landing was uneventful. The professor waded his way through the cesspool that was the Nebraska airport and found his friend. This friend lived out in the empty fields of Nebraska. “A humble, yet satisfying life,” he called it. They took a beat-up pickup truck with certain bumper stickers on it to the friend’s house. As expected, the friend lived in a little house on the prairie. There was not another soul in sight.\n\nThe professor decided that he wanted to shoot a bird. The friend thought it was a good idea. But the professor had forgotten all about the storm on the way into Nebraska. So, the meteorologist and the farmer headed out to an empty field to shoot birds. The friend, of course, was able to shoot a respectable number of birds. The professor held no such skills in his own repertoire. He was far too busy watching the dark clouds form above. After all, his job was to teach others to do the same. He figured they had time before the clouds opened up. He was wrong. Suddenly, the heavens poured forth a torrent unlike any that the professor had ever seen. A nearby tree ruptured with the force of lightning. The professor screamed over the wind: “Let us vacate this area! It’s too much of a storm to handle!” The ardent farmer did not want to go home without one more bird. The professor kept insisting that they leave. The farmer then asked, “*How* do you know that we must leave?” The professor replied, “I know we must leave because I am an expert in this field!”",

The young lad cant believe it, its the bike he has always wanted and its in pristine condition. They have some small talk about bikes and riding stories. The old man finally says, \"I'm going to sell you the bike, I'm getting too old to ride and I see you really appreciate this model, and motorcycles in general. So i'll know you will take real good care of her.\" The young gent is super excited. \"One more thing before you leave, take this bottle of vasoline, put it on the chrome if it rains to prevent rust\" The old man said. He then rides off with his newly acquired bike to pick up his girlfriend. She is excited to see him on it, and she admits he looks very hot while riding. Tonight he is meeting her parents for the first time so he wanted to make a good first impression. She jumps on and they take off to her parents house. \n\n\"Now before we go in there is something I must tell\", she says. \"We have this crazy rule at the dinner table. If you are caught talking you have to wash the dishes\", she warned. \"It's okay, I will just focus on my meal\", he replied. When they were greeted at the door, he walked inside and he couldn't believe it. There were dirty dishes everywhere, piled up in the living room, hallways, the foyer, the stairway, and of course the kitchen. Some how, her mother was able to make dinner and they all sat down to eat.\n\nSo they are eating and the young man is getting pretty bored with the silence, the father reading his newspaper, the mother watching t.v. from the table. He is feeling a little cheeky and decides to start rubbing his girlfriends thighs till she is biting her lip. He looks up and the parents are continuing no paying attention. Then he decides to up the ante and then starts making out with her and fondling her breast. Not a peep from the parents. Then he decides, to put his girlfriend on the table and just starts fucking her on the table, really getting into it. The parents just continue to ignore the spectacle. He looks at the mom, grabs her to join and then starts fingering her on the table as well. while all this fuckery is going on the man sees its starts raining out side, he remembers and pulls out the vasoline. The father then abruptly stands up and says.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Alright fuck! I wash the damn dishes!\"",

Trap me inside and release me once you've made sure the wishes came true.\n\n\nI stopped for a second, then agreed. After placing the frog inside, I told it my three wishes.\n\n\n- I want a giant mansion where my house currently is.\n\n\n- Done.\n\n\n- I want mounds and mounds of money.\n\n\n- You got it.\n\n\n- I want two hot blondes who will love me forever.\n\n\n- Granted.\n\n\nI didn't believe it, so I went home and checked, and sure enough, everything was as I requested. Two attractive girls walked out of the multi-million dollar mansion and greeted me with a hug, then led me to a foyer where small hills of 100$ bills were scattered across the floor.\n\n\nI decided to go back to the forest to thank the frog. As I released it, it spoke again.\n\n\n- You are very welcome, but I do have one small request.\n\n\n- Whatever it is, I can do it. - I told it, - You've turned my life around, it's the least I can do.\n\n\n- I want you to have sex with me.\n\n\nIt was a strange request, but the frog had done much more than that for me, so I decided to do it.\n\n\nAs we were having sex, suddenly the frog flashed with a bright light and turned into a cute, little fourteen-year-old girl.\"\n\n\nThat's what happened, your honor, don't listen to that bald lawyer asshole!",

He picks it up and listens to the caller without saying a single word, than he hung up. The car brakes sharply, turns around and drives backwards. In ten minutes they are back at Capo's house where he holds another guy kneeling at his feet on the driveway.

The hunter gets really nervous and pleads the tiger not to kill him. \n\nThe tiger says,\"I won't kill you but only on one condition. You have to let me fuck you\". Seeing no other option the hunter says yes and the tiger has his way with him.\n\nThe hunter feels humiliated and vows to come back the next day and hunt the tiger.  So the next day the hunter arrives at the same place and waits in hiding until he spots the tiger again. This time he shoots two bullets aiming at the tiger. But the tiger is quite alert because of the events of the previous day, so he manages to evade the bullets.\n\nThe hunter starts saying his last words when the tiger comes to him and says, \"I don't think you have learnt a lesson yet. But you're a nice man, so I'll let you go. But the deal remains the same\". The tiger screws the hunter and lets him go.\n\nNow the hunter is completely infuriated and comes back the third time deciding to kill the tiger once and for all. But the same thing happens all over and the tiger manages to go unharmed. \n\nHaving no choice, the hunter drops his pants and leans against a tree waiting for the tiger to have his way with him. The tiger comes near the hunter, taps him gently and says, \"Do you really come here to hunt or just get fucked in the ass?\".\n\nTLDR: Tiger Daddy horny, Michael!",

    "selftext": "One day a sheep was grazing in its field, when it looked up to see the shepherd talking with a cloaked stranger.  Once the conversation had finished, the shepherd hurried over to the sheep.\n\n\"Sheep, sheep!\" said the shepherd.  \"I just met the strangest man!  He kept saying, 'Shop cheese the is where?'  Eventually I figured that he must be asking where the cheese shop is, so I gave him directions.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the sheep.  \"I know what's going on here.  That man has backwardsism.  It's a disease that makes you speak and hear things backwards.\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" cried the shepherd.  \"How dreadful!  I hope he's able to find the cheese shop.  I told him, 'Go right, then left.'\"\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" said the sheep.  \"I speak fluent backwards and what you told him was, 'Left, then right go.'  That's gonna lead him straight to the bread and eggs shop.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" cried the shepherd.  \"What have I done?  Now he may never get his cheese!\"\n\nSure enough, about an hour later, the cloaked stranger returned to the field with one bag full of bread and one bag full of eggs.  \"Cheese any have didn't they,\" he explained.\n\n\"Sheep,\" said the shepherd, \"please tell this man of my folly and my regret.  And, to make it up to him, tell him that he is free to stay at my cottage for the evening if he hasn't somewhere else to stay.\"\n\nThe sheep did so, and the cloaked stranger gratefully accepted the offer.\n\nThat night, in the shepherd's kitchen, the cloaked man asked him, \"Dinner for something you make I can?\"\n\nThe shepherd turned to his trusty dog and asked, \"Do you know what he said?\"\n\n\"Oh, he just wants to know what you'd like for dinner,\" said the dog.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the shepherd with a smile.  Not wanting the stranger's earlier purchase to go to waste, the shepherd turned to him and said, \"Fried eggs on toast.\"\n\nThe cloaked stranger nodded.  He then proceeded to crack two eggs into a bowl, scramble them, put some toast on top of the eggs, and then fry the result.\n\nThe shepherd was confused.  \"I didn't ask for french toast,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, you did,\" corrected the dog.  \"He hears things backward, so you said, 'Toast on eggs, fried.'\"\n\n\"Oh, curses!\" cried the shepherd.  \"Well, that's okay.  I do like french toast.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said the dog, \"maybe from now on you should let us animals translate whatever you want to say.  To avoid confusion.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a wonderful idea!  Can you relay that to him?\"\n\nThe dog did so.  Then the shepherd and the cloaked stranger had a lovely meal together.\n\nThe next morning the shepherd awoke to find the cloaked man sitting at his desk, quill in hand, scrawling on a piece of parchment.  The shepherd walked over to see what the man was writing, and was horrified to find the stranger drawing a crude picture of a penis.\n\nThe shepherd ran down into the kitchen and woke the dog.\n\n\"Dog!  Dog!\" cried the shepherd.  \"The cloaked stranger is drawing a phallus!  Why would he do such a thing?\"\n\nThe dog looked at the shepherd and said, \"Probably because the rooster went, 'Cock a doodle do.'\"",

There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. \n\nOne day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me.\" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, \"We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family\".\n\nThe moral of this story is:\n\nAlways keep your condoms in your car.",

The pianist went on to play the most energetic and whimsical jazz solo the manager had ever heard.\n\nObviously, the manager was stunned. “That was actually rather brilliant, do you however happen to know any quieter tracks?”.\n\n“Yes of course, here’s one known as “I Was Batting Off to a Photo of Your Daughter But My Wife Walked In So Now She’s Divorced M-“\n\n“Excuse me please but such things cannot be said in this restaurant, how dar-“\n\n“No sir, believe me, it’s a fantastic track, I’m sure you and all of your patrons will love it”.\n\nWaved on, the pianist begins to play the most beautiful, slow, and solemn ballad the manager has ever heard in his life. “That was quite something. Is there any chance you know any blues?”\n\nWithout a word the pianist started tapping away, perfect timing, perfect progressions, perfect everything. It was a stunning blues performance.\n\nThe manager, stunned almost beyond words, fathomed, “Amazing! What was that one called?”\n\n“‘As Your Father Gave Me a Colonoscopy I Accidentally Jizzed All Over The Operating Table’”.\n\nThe manager flinched, and after a moment proposed - “You really are incredibly good, if I was to hire you could you refrain from sharing your song titles with any of our diners?\"\n\n\"Absolutely\". And the pianist was hired on the spot.\n\nA couple of months go by, and the pianist has been doing very well so far, and hasn't opened his mouth once about his song titles, even when asked. One night, however, the pianist is playing away on a particularly busy evening, and has been bursting at the seams of his bladder since he first sat down. During a quick one minute speech from the owner, the pianist decides to take the opportunity to sprint to the bathroom and relieve himself. Halfway through his toilet visit, he hears his boss from the bar - \"where's that fucking pianist?\"\n\nWithout properly preparing himself, the pianist runs out of the bathroom, cock out and all, and sits back down and starts playing away. After his next song concluded, one of the patrons walks over and asks - \"Do you know your cock is hanging out and dripping piss all over the floor?\".\n\nThe pianist replies - \"Know it? I wrote it!\"",

The second raven asked the first raven: \n\n\"Hey pal, what are you up to?\" \n\n\"Nothing\", the first raven answered, \"I am just sitting on my ass.\"\n\nThe second raven was seemingly impressed by the beauty of his new friends' words and answered: \"What a great idea, let me join you!\"\n\nAfter some time a little rabbit came across the big oak, when he suddenly realized two ravens sitting on their asses on a solid branch.\n\n\"What are you guys doing?\", the rabbit asked.\n\n\"Not much, we are just sitting on our asses\", the ravens answered.\n\nThe rabbit also liked the idea and looked for a shady, but cosy spot beneath the big oak.\n\nTime passed and a fox came by. Firstly, he wanted to attack the rabbit, but then he realised that the rabbit was not alone: There were to ravens unmistakably sitting their asses on this solid branch and also the rabbit didn't seem to do any more.\n\n\"What are you three guys doing there?\"\n\n\"Hardly anything, we are just sitting our asses\", the three animals answered, and the fox joined the rabbit beneath the tree.\n\nThe four animals spent several hours in this position, living in peace and perfect harmony.\n\nSuddenly, out of thin air, a really loud explosion was hearable, followed by a second.\nThe rabbit was smashed against the oak because of the power of the gun the hunter has used. But also the fox was dead immediatly after the missile has hit his head trough his right eye.\n\nOne of the ravens leaned towards the other \"See, sitting on one's ass is only possible in a higher position.\"",

As he got closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. He coughed to let the women know he was there and they all swam down to the deep end of the pond.\n\nOne of the women shouted, \"We're not coming out until you leave!\" The old man replied, \"Ladies, I didn't come down here to watch you swim naked or make you get out of the pond.\", and they all let out a sigh of relief.\n\nHolding the bucket up he said, \"I came down here to feed the alligator!\"",

On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.\n\nAs we passed, they all said in unison, \"You may now kiss the bride!\" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.\n\nAs we walked away I asked, \"Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?\"\n\nMy wife answered, \"In Soviet Russia, the punchline tells you!\"",

After a moment of consideration, the preacher asked, \"Will you take my bike in trade for it?\"  The little boy asked if he could try it out first, and, after riding the bike around a little while, said, \"Mister, you've got yourself a deal.\"  The preacher took the mower and began to crank it.

The preacher called the little boy over and said, \"I can't get this mower to start.\"  The little boy said, \"That's because you have to cuss at it to get it started.\"  The preacher said, I'm a minister, and I can't cuss. It's been so long since I've been saved that I don't even remember how to cuss.\"  The little boy looked at him happily and said, \"You just keep pulling on that rope. It'll come back to ya!\"",

All of a sudden, a bright light shined down from heaven. A voice thundered, \"You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you now? Am I to count you as a believer?\"\n\nThe atheist thought for a second, then answered. \"It would be hypocritical of me to proclaim myself as a believer after all these years; but, perhaps you could spare my life by making the bear a believer in your laws.\n\n\"very well\", said the voice. \"I'll try\".\n\nThe light vanished. The river started moving again. And then the bear put his paws together, bowed his head, and spoke:\n\n\"Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful. Amen.\"",

This saddened me to no end, I don’t think it would be right build an entertainment business on top of plot holes so I backed down.",

    "selftext": "...from an *extremely* Christian gated community. She worked from home making just enough to get by, so she didn't have to find a new job. She decides to send her little 6 year old boy to a public school to save some money. Over the years that little boy learned a few new words and phrases and was smart enough to not say it around his mom. About 10 years later, he is 16 years old and hasn't had a single slip of the mouth with his mom around. One day, she decided to give him his first video game. GTAV. Naturally, she didn't think it was bad at all. The thing is, she didn't know it's pretty vulgar. After he starts walking down the street in the game, a prostitute shouts, \"You're so fucking shitty!\" The mother passing by, not knowing what those words mean, asked her son about it. He said really quickly while not thinking, \"fucking is just another way of saying something is great and shitty is another way of saying well dressed.\" The mother, not knowing any better just thought he was telling the truth and kept on with her business. It also helped that the character was wearing a suit. Later on, he's still walking around in GTA and the mother hears the game again. This time she hears it say, \"The fucking bitches and bastards that are in this town are shitty people!\" The mother, still not knowing a couple of those words, asked her son what they mean. The son said quickly, \"Bitches is an alternative term for ladies and bastards is an alternative term for gentlemen.\" The mother accepted it still none-the-wiser. As she was walking out of his room, he was getting chased and knew he was going to die. She heard him say under his breath, \"I'm damned.\" The mother, that hasn't ever heard that term before asked him what that means too. He said while readjusting himself on his beanbag chair, \"Damned means really comfortable.\" She still accepted his answer as the truth. Later on that evening, the mother hosted a dinner party with their neighbors. As the guests walked in, the mother said, \"Hello bitches and bastards, find a damned seat. We have a lot of fucking food on the table and you all look shitty!\"",

You know, king and all that goes with it. They got married, lived happily ever after until the fox got pregnant. That sounded cool until she gave birth to...5 pink, cute piglets. The lion as an alpha male got really mad and dumped her in an instant.\n\nNow we have the fox-pretty and elegant but with the little piglets on her hands and her future is not looking as bright as it did. But one day the wolf approached her:\n\n\\-I wanna marry you, you are so attractive that by merely showing around me you'll increase my profile. I'll take care of you and your piglets but there is one condition-don't cheat on me or there will be violence!\n\nThe cornered fox readily agreed and soon they were married. In a year or 2 tho she got pregnant and what do you know-she gave birth to 6 cute, tiny piglets! As promised the wolf erupted in short, firm violence and not long after the fox was single again.\n\nNow nobody wanted to marry her and her future started looking grim with all the little piglets on her hands. But one day the rabbit approached her:\n\n\\-I have always been in love with you girl, I thought I have no chance with you but now that no one wants you can I offer my help? I have just one thing to ask you-I love you too much so please don't cheat on me or my heart will be broken and I will have to suicide. The fox happily agrees and they live happily ever after. Until.... several years later she gets pregnant. The whole forest anxiously expects the results and the naysayers are not disappointed-the fox gives birth to 7 healthy piglets! The fox grabs his gun, says goodbye and through his tears asks:\n\n\\-I told you'll break my heart, you'll kill me....why did you have to cause this to me?\n\n\\-Well honey tell me what I can do. You know all men are pigs, right?",

It’s a public place! We’ll get caught!!”\n“We won’t, trust me, every one is asleep, no one will notice. Cmon.” \n“No fucking way”\n“Cmon, you know you want to”\n“No!”\n“Cmon, just a quickie.”\n“For the last fucking time” the other whisper shouted “NO! WE WILL GET CAUGHT”\n\n\n“Look” said the adventurous one as he stood up and shouted across the whole cabin “HELP!!! HELP!!!” The whole plane remained silent and uninterested in what was going on \n\nThe other boyfriend finally gave in and said “Alright, you made your point. Let’s do this.”\n\nThey have sex and then go to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, the cabin crew found a passenger who was covered in blood and vomit and eyes red as the blood all over him. They asked him why he hadn’t called for help earlier. \n\nTo this he replied, “The last person who asked for help had brains fucked out of him.”",

He asks one of the waitresses there to speak to the manager, who he approaches and asks, \n\n\"Are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?\" \n\nThe manager, taken very much aback, responds, \"Excuse me? I am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?\"\n\n\"Good! 'Cause I need some fucking work and I'm half decent on the keys!\" \n\nAnd he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard. \n\n\"D..did you write that? That was beautiful! What's it called?\" \n\n\"That I did! It's called, Why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?\" \n\nAghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks \"Do you know any jazz? Anything a little more intricate?\" \n\n\"'Course I do!\" \n\nAnd again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard. \n\nBracing for the name of this track, he asks \"Well what do you call it?\" \n\n\"I'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!\" \n\nAppalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees. \n\n*Later that evening...* \n\nAbout 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. After slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to \"deal with the stress of performing\", as he justifies it. \n\nWell, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells\n\n\"Christ mate, where have you been?! The people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! Don't you fuck this up for me!\"\n\nBefore leaving the bathroom abrutply. \n\nThe pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing. \n\nAfter his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers \n\n\"Excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?\"\n\nStunned, the pianist turns to her and says \n\n\"Know it?! I wrote that fucking song!\"",

She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, which she closed behind him, and took him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.\n\nWhen he had enough, they went downstairs and she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied, she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge. \"All this was just too wonderful for words,\" he said, \"But what's the dollar for?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"Last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you.

When she picks her crop in the autumn, her carrots, potatoes, onions, and spring beans have all failed, but her cauliflowers have grown a treat.\n\nShe picks them, cooks some for Sunday lunch in a cheese sauce, and they taste wonderful.\n\nAfter eating them for a week she notices two things. Firstly, her lips are full and glossy, unchapped, uncracked, and require absolutely no lip gloss to make them look full and pouty.\n\nSecondly she has really awful bad breath and even her cat won't come near her.\n\nPleased with her lips, however, and spotting a money-making idea, she contacts a big cosmetics company and explains about the lip-enhancing qualities of her cauliflower crop.\n\nAfter a month of testing the company buys the entire crop of cauliflowers for a phenomenal amount and requests that Mary grow some more as soon as possible.\n\nThe company proceeds to make lipstick out of them but experiences problems in the the final product manufacture. The lipstick does not gel correctly into a solid stick and ends up crumbling upon application. Quality controllers also find that, even as a lipstick, the bad breath remains and have to put it down as an unfortunate side effect.\n\nAs they are nearing their production deadline and adverts for this new wonder lip enhancer have hit the streets, the cosmetics company has no choice but to produce the packaging with the following caution.\n\nPoppins' Pop-up Lip Enhancer:\n\nSUPER CAULI, FRAGILE LIPSTICK - EXPECT-HALITOSIS",

    "selftext": "So there’s an 18 year old guy who’s doing well for himself. He graduated from high school and immediately went to work. In a year he moved into his own apartment. It was a cheap place but still his own. But one day not long after his 19th birthday he starts hearing voices and he lives alone. He panics and calls the hospital and checks himself in. The doctors put him on medication for schizophrenia and while he’s in the mental health unit the symptoms seemed to go away so he went back home. He stopped the meds because they made him feel odd. Only to find that the voices would come back to haunt him. He’s in and out of the hospital for years. Finally he moves to a new City in a better apartment. Turns out his old apartment just had really thin walls.",

That can't possibly be right, I've never paid that much to see the doctor.\"\n\nThe receptionist looked over the paper again, \"Well it's $100 copay for the doctors visit, but then it shows you also requested a cat scan, a lab report, a Collin-oscopy, a ma'am-ogram, and a stool analysis.\"",

However, she insisted she wanted to spice things up, so I figured I would give it a try.\n\nUnfortunately, after going at it for a while she started to feel some pain and we had to stop.  I figured that was the end of it.\n\nHowever, the next night she tells me she went to the sex store and they provided her with this special lubricant that is supposed to stop the pain for her, so she wants to try it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lube totally worked.

On Sam's tour, he was singing, like any ordinary song, and then, suddenly, he sung a note so perfect it could melt hearts.  A member of the audience who happened to be a Father of a church cried out that he knew what that was; a holy note.  He explained that a holy note was extremely rare, and could only be sung by the most talented of singers.  Now that it was known that Sam was able to sing holy notes, his tours became infinitely times more popular.  As he toured the world, Sam sung holy notes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then his tour was over.  After the tour, Sam decided to go back o his home town of Samsville for one last show to the people he knew and loved.  He performed the show in their local church which was oddly large, and the mayor of the town attended.  About halfway during the performance, Sam sung a note so horrible that it sounded like a cross between a loud metal fork being scraped across a dinner plate and a demon screeching.  After he sung this note, Sam burst into flames and melted to the ground in a puddle of human goo.  Everyone was so shocked, the whole church was silent.  After a moment, the mayor questioned what just happened.  The Father of the church looked at the mayor with a sad look and said, \"don't you know mayor... Sam sung Note 7...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnd of joke, if you didn't get it, here's an explanation.  The phone Samsung Note 7 was notorious for bursting into flames so at the end of the joke where the Father says that Sam sung Note 7, its a joke about the phone.  I know it's less funny when I have to explain it, but to some of the people that I have told this joke to in real life, I had to explain it.  :D",

After what felt like an eternety it was finally Davids turn, he saw a little peek hole and peeked in. It was two women having sex with each other. David was so pleasantly surprised that he told the guy behind him ''Hey dude, this is pretty great for being completely free!'' to which he replied ''Yeah dude you're lucky, yesterday a man was fucking a pig!

    "selftext": "they didn't have much as way of entertainment except for fishing and hunting with his big shaggy dog, Bear. When he wasn't helping his parents out with chores, he spent most of his summers out in the forests camping with Bear, hunting squirrels and rabbits, or just fishing along the river. He'd wandered a bit further away one day than he normally did, and came across an old monastary with a congregation of friars. \n\nNow, this region of Kentucky wasn't very well off, so what a lot of the small town farmers did was take their goods in to the larger city to sell at farmers markets and to stores. The friars were no exception to this because while they didn't need much money, they did need some to buy food and clothes. When my grandfather came across that old monastary, he'd seen acre after acre of wide open meadows just full of wildflowers of every sort you could imagine. Big yellow flowers, little red and blue speckled flowers, daisies, queen's lace. The fields were alive with bees buzzing and humming birds humming, truly, it was a beautiful, inspiring sight. And out there, scattered throughout the meadows, the friars, each with a big woven basket filled to the brim with boquets they crafted by hand. These were what they would send in to town to be sold.\n\nMy great grandfather, that is, my grandpa's dad, worked for a man that lived in the city most of the local farmers would travel to to sell their produce. This man was a baron of sorts; he owned several businesses in town and he was always on the look out for a new business or property to invest in to grow his wealth. His name was Hugh, and he wasnt known for his huge, friendly demeanor. What he was known for was his ruthless and cunning sense of busines. Hugh never let anything get in his way when it came to growing his business. \n\nA year after my grandpa and Bear met the friars, a reporter came to town to photograph the festival they had every summer in town. This festival was the town's yearly highlight, at least as big a deal as Thanksgiving and nearly as big a deal as Easter and Christmas (which in those days made it a Very Big Deal indeed)! Every year for the festival the friars would supply the most stunning flower arrangements for the town's main street, through which the town would have a small parade with the mayor tossing candies for all the children, and men and women in costumes dancing along to music played by the school's small band. Folk from all around the town would journey in for the day, set up food stalls to sell pies and hot cakes, roast rabbit on toast and spicy squirrel stew. This year the festival was held in even higher anticipation because of the participation of the local fire department. They'd offered to lead the parade with a big red firetruck, and the firemen all dressed up in celebration. \n\nThe fire department's presence was as much for the celebration as it was for safety. The previous year an unfortunate accident had caused a large fire to catch and spread to the forest around the town. Several blocks of the town had been evacuated before the fire was finally contained and put out, but not before some acres of the forest had burned down. But that event had gotten my grandpa's small town on the radar of the big city, and the local paper had decided to feature them in an article this particular summer! \n\nThe festival was a tremendous success! The food was fantastic, the parade was picturesque! The friars flower displays were the highlight of the night, and the photographer made sure to do them as much justice as he could. Truly, they were the talk of the festival, to the point that some weeks later at the next farmers market in the city, the friars sold out of their boquets in the first hour of the morning! Word had spread, pardon the pun, like a fire, and everyone wanted to buy the friars flowers!\n\nEven old Hugh had seen and heard word of the sudden popularity of these boquets and went down to the market to see for himself. He stood, mouth agape, as a crowed massed around the floral displays, pushing to be the next to buy before the flowers were all gone. Much to the dismay of the friars, their newfound popularity lead to incredible new demand. And though they did try to prepare more boquets for the market, they were realy selling more than they'd ever intended. For while the did it for a little money to afford necessiries, for the friars, spreading beauty and peace with their flowers was more than enough in return.\n\nWhen Hugh saw the potential in the popularity of the flowers the friars grew, his mind immediately started working on a way to turn it to his benefit. He waited for the crowds to finally die down and went to speak to the holy men. \n\n\"I'd like to make you an offer,\" Hugh said. \"Your beautiful flowers are the talk of the town. I'd like to help you out by handling all the sales of the flowers for you, for a small cut of the profit! That way, you can focus on growing and creating your wonderful boquets, without worrying about the hassle and bother of coming into the market each week and dealing with the crowds!\"\n\nThe friars thanked Hugh for his offer, but they explained to him that for them, the boquets were not just a business endeavor, it was their service to the community to spread peace and joy with God's flowers and blessings. And with that, the friars packed up and started the journey back to their monastary.\n\nWell, Hugh was not satisfied at all with that answer, and he came up with a plan. Over the next few weeks he ordered crate after craft of exotic flowers from all around the world. Beautiful flowers from Morocco to France, stunning petals from China to India. Anything colorful and amazing that he could learn about. He set up a large shop just down the road from the Farmer's market where the Friars had their stall, and he called it The Festival Flourist and Fantastic Flowers. At first, the town was abuzz with these new and wonderful flowers, but after a few weeks, as the novelty wore off, the sales declined and soon Hugh's shop was empty. \n\nFor some reason he couldn't figure out, though, the friars were doing as well as ever! Week in and out, lines down the street would stand patiently waiting for the friars flowers. And cunning as he was, Hugh would not rest until he'd made his new business a success. \n\nA year or so later, my grandpa was on another fishing adventure with Bear, just following allong with stream, sometimes wading through the shallower parts of the water, othertimes dropping in a line and resting in the shade of a tree, when he saw thick, black smoke rising above the forest. Curious as any young boy would be, he set off at a run through the trees, heading towards the smoke. \n\nWhen he reached a large open meadow, a devastating sight lay before him: dozens of friars with brooms and small buckets were frantically working through the flower meadows tyring their best to fight thick, hot flames that were scorching along the ground! Some how, all the flower meadows had caught fire, and try as they might, nothing the friars could do was stopping the flames. \n\nThe fire department was evnetually contacted and they made it out to the monastary before too much of the forest had burned down, but sadly all of the flowers in the meadows had been left a charred, ruined mess. For the first time in years, the friars had no flowers to for the town's festival. Full of dismay, they sent word to the mayor that there was nothing they could do to salvage the flower displays for that year's parade, and whispers grew with worry that the festival that year might not live up to the town's hopes. \n\nIt was then that, just by hapenstance, Hugh visited town to meet with the mayor about opening a new business there in town. When he heard about the problems with the fire and the flowers, of course he'd be delighted to supply the town with all the flowers they could need, for a small fee. In the end, I'm afraid that there's no truly happy ending here: the Mayor accepted Hugh's flowers and his flower shop's popularity grew from then on. \n\nBut the moral of the story is this, my friends: \n\nHugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars. ",

The estimate calls for 100 gallons of white latex paint but he decided to buy only one 20 gallon can  he knows latex paint can be thinned with water. So he diluted 1:1 and it still coats and looks white. So he dilutes again to stretch out the paint (much like I’m doing with the joke)   So as he is painting he keeps diluting to make 20 into 100. As he finishes a dark cloud appears and a torrential rain washes all the paint away. A voice calls out “Repaint and thin no more “. ( originally told from pulpit many years ago).",

    "selftext": " Dear Mom,  \n\n\nWe are having a great time here at Camp Hazardous Hills. Grandpa is making me write to you in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away.  \n\n\nLuckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Cousin Brian  when it happened. Oh yes, please call Brian's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.  \n\n\nScoutmaster got mad at Brian  for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Brian  said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas could blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also, some of our clothes. cousin Dave is going to look weird until his hair grows back.  \n\n\nWe will be home on Saturday if Unclle Jim gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Uncle Jimsaid that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.  \n\n\nYou were right, dad is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching stepmom cindy how to drive. But he only lets her drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.  \n\n\nThis morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. grandpa wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Brian  was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so dad let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Grandpa isn't crabby like some geezers. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets.  \n\n\nHe has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When David dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also aunt Liola and I threw up. Dad said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken.  \n\n\nI have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.  \n\n\nLove,  \nYour son  \n\n\nP.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?",

His name is also Rex, as our parents only planned for one of us they said we had to share the name. We shared everything growing up, but my brother was always less happy than me, until the day he became a sailor. Turns out he can't stand being on land the same way I can't stand being at sea.

The captain looked for Rex to speak to him about his twin. Upon finding him he couldn't help himself and started joking about him, just as he and the crew had done to his brother back at the tavern.\n\nImmediately the entire crew became angry and surrounded the captain with stern looks on their faces. The biggest and strongest of the crewmen stepped forward, leaned down to come eye-to-eye with the new captain and growled at him, \"You listen up, new captain, and listen good: It's one thing to joke about tavern Rex, but we *never* joke about ship Rex.\"",

    "selftext": "A brilliant scientist, by the name of Dr. Elliot Kupferberg, assembled yet another fruitful invention that would slap anyone who dared to lie within its presence. But one last piece remained. He knew, as a scientist, that he needed to test his potentially dangerous contraption on humans. So he thought, '*This is what my wife is for, right? No matter what happens it's a win-win for me!'* He decided to test the machine on his son as well.  \n\nHe brought his apparatus with him and met with his wife and child downstairs. By putting the machine under the table prior to the meeting, he was sure they would remain unaware of his plans. He asked his son what he did that evening, fully aware of his son's lewd and yet so predictable nature. \n\nHe proceeded to question.\n\n\"Son, can you tell me exactly what you did this evening?\" He needed not to observe his son's grotesque features, because he was confident that his contraption would serve him well.\n\n\"Well, Dad, I spent the evening reading in my room.\" Surprisingly, the machine did nothing. Dr. Kupferberg was struck with surprise. Mostly due to the fact that his son might have took a day off from his heinous deeds. But then again, he thought, '*People do change.'* \n\nFor the purpose of clarification, he decided he should ask one more question. \n\n\"Son, what book did you read?\"\n\n\"Uh, I read Sun Tzu's *The Art of War.*\" The son was quickly belted across the face. The father knew he had won. \n\n\"Son, what did you really read?\"\n\n\"Ok, ok, I read *Beauty Bombshells III:World War Asian!\"*\n\nHe wasn't surprised, but he knew his son had to change. He decided this would be a good teaching moment.\n\n\"Son, how lewd of you! When I was your age when I saw someone else do this I would refer the child to a psychiatrist! I could only see this in movies and I would be sick to my stomach! I never did things like this!\"\n\nThe machine slapped the father. While at a loss for words, he realized that he and his son were two peas in a pod. \n\nAs he felt a sudden bout of love, his wife said happily, \n\n\"He sure is your son!\" They laughed together.\n\nThe wife was soon slapped.",

He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. And, since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.\n\nAfter a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to [get their licks in]. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.\n\nThe sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.”\n\nThe man asks, “Why not?”\n\nAnd the sheriff replies, “Because this is the punch line.”",

The door is closed behind him and almost immediately there are massive screams and shouts coming from behind the door, screams which last for nearly ten minutes... There is banging up against the sides of the door and everything and then silence.

What makes it extra special is that the boars don’t live in a forest or meadow: they live in a large freshwater lake.\n\nI’d only been there once or twice when I was a child, but 3 months ago I bought myself a bicycle in an effort to get fit. This reduced the journey time to only 12 minutes and 30 seconds and I started visiting *regularly*.\n\nWatching the herds of hairy pigs frolicking in the crystal clear water I felt a spiritual connection, a deep bond between the fauna and their environment. I started to wonder if I could develop such a symbiosis in my own life.\n\nI traveled to the lake every evening in my free time, staring at the scene for hours at a time. I was becoming obsessed. In order to understand the link between the boars and their lake home I was eating only boiled bacon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If I ate them, perhaps I could become them, I thought. When my evening cycles to the waterfront no longer satisfied my lust for wet swine I simply stopped going to work, and would stand knee-deep in the water from dawn to dusk looking longingly at the animals and deeply inhaling the intoxicating smell of their shit beneath my feet.\n\nNot long after this my girlfriend left me. She was already annoyed when I’d started calling her Miss Piggy in bed but the final straw came a few days later. She woke up at 4am and found me kneeling in the kitchen sink, overflowing with water, masturbating to the dramatic final act of Babe the Sheep-Pig, oinking wildly as I came.\"\n\n**Doctor:** \"Why are you telling me all this?\"\n\n**Patient:** \"What I’m trying to say is that ever since I got my bicycle, Boar Lake has been a real problem for me.\"",

    "selftext": "...the disheveled, homeless drunk read on the poster taped up on the bar door. It continued:\n\n    **Complete each of the bar's** \n    **four IMPOSSIBLE challenges to win** \n    **a round of 10 drinks each!**\n    \n    Complete ALL four challenges at once and win...\n    \n\n    DRINKS FOR LIFE!!!\n\n    Inquire within for details.\n\nThe drunk straightened up his nonexistent tie, licked his palm to slick back his hair, and walked right through the door, past the plethora of patrons, and straight up to the bar.\n\nThe bartender, who was busy cleaning glasses, took one look at the bum, and asked, \"So I take it you're here about the challenge?\"\n\nThe bum nodded, hiccuped, and slurred out, \"Yesshuree, I shure am!\"\n\nThe bartender rolled his eyes, then explained, \"Alright, each of the challenges nets you ten drinks. If you manage to do all four challenges before we close up for the night, you'll be swimming in more alcohol then you'll know what to do with. For the first challenge, you'll need to nail this railroad spike,\" as he picked up a 12-incher from behind the bar and placed it on the counter, \"into the sticking post in the men's room with any of the eggs from the pickle jar. Afterwards, you'll need to climb up to the rooftop of this building. From there, you'll have to piss into one of our shotglasses left on ground level and fill it up to the brim. Then, there's Rocky, the rottweiler in the yard out back. You'll need to pull the thorn out of his paw, and he doesn't much like strangers. Finally, you'll be going upstairs where you'll find my grandmother, this town's most insatiable, randy woman in the past sixty years. If you can give her the best fucking of her life, you'll win your prize.\"\n\nBy this point, the entire bar establishment had gathered to see if the old coot will follow through with the challenges. With a smirk on his face, he immediately snatched up the railroad spike, reached barehanded into the pickle jar to yank out an egg, and marched straight into the lavatory, where he was followed by a few male patrons to witness the act. The restroom erupted with cheers, hollers, and hoots interspersed with the old man's \"goddammit\"s, \"shiiiit\"s, and \"ah fucking hell\"s. Eventually a unified cheer erupted within the small area of the bar and the old man walked out with one egg-covered, bloody stump of a hand and a wide smile.\n\nHe marched back over to the bar, tapped the bartop, and said, \"My drinkssh, pleeash...\"\n\nThe bartender poured out ten shots of the cheapest swill he carried and the drunk downed 'em as quickly as they were poured without crossing his eyes. He kept the final shotglass in hand as he made his way out the front door. A vast majority of the bar followed him out, starting up a rhythmic chant to keep him going. You could tell from within the bar that it must have been going well, since the rhythm of the chant picked up more and more after awhile and ended with another unified cheer.\n\nThe old drunk stumbled back in and, wordlessly, pointed his finger on top of the bar again. The bartender set up another ten shots and the drunk gulped down all ten. The entire bar was erupting with cheers at this point. The drunk then took a deep breath and barely kept himself upright as he veritably flopped out the back door, naturally followed by almost the entire bar at this point. However, once in the yard, instead of the usual cheers that occurred, there was a smattering of \"oooh\"s and \"uuuuhhhh\"s, interjected by occasional \"what the fuck\"s. There could be heard, between the reactions of the crowd, the growls and snarls of a wild beast, followed by loud yelps and extremely loud whimpering. Eventually, hushed silence followed and some of the patrons preceded the stumbling, old drunk into the bar as they dove straight for the restrooms, covering the vomit in their mouths.\n\nThe drunk, now covered in scrapes, scratches, and abrasions, pointed to the bar again as the bartender already began lining up glasses and pouring shots for him to down. Once the last shot had been drank, and everyone was certain the old man wouldn't keel over or pass out, he managed to half speak, half belch...\n\n\"Now, where's that old bitch with the thorn in her paw?!?\"",

However the king's closest advisor insisted that the king divulge the secret behind this extremely rare specimen. The king finally caved and secretly told him that deep in the woods lie an old hermit with magic powers and he is able to grant one wish to any who asks him.\n\nThe advisor thought the king a fool to waste his wish and determined to find this magic hermit and demand riches. So with this in mind the advisor set into the woods and eventually found the old man in a state of zen under a 100 year old tree. The advisor dropped to his knees and begged the hermit to grant him a biggest bag of gold coins. The hermit considered for a moment, waved his staff and ordered the man to return to his home to find what he seeks. Needless to say, the advisor ran back to his house at top speed. \n\nInside, he found a large sack full of the most worn out cheap metal coins one could find with total worth being less than what the advisor earned in a week. Feeling cheated he went to the king and told him the entire story ending with the large bag of old coins. The king gave a hearty laugh and said: \n\nWhat I didnt tell you was that the old man is very hard of hearing. Did you REALLY think I wished for a 12 Inch Chick.",

So next thing you know the man is at the craps table with his whole life savings in front of him, he looks at the frog in his pocket. \"Ribbit, black 8\", it croaked. Suddenly the man is a millionaire and buys the best penthouse in the hotel. He jumps into bed with extreme joy and says, \"Wow Lucky frog, you've changed my life. How can I ever repay you?\" \"Ribbit, kiss me\" says the lucky frog. Sure he thought, So the man kissed the frog and it magically turned into a beautiful, volumptous, blonde, 16 year old girl.\n\n \"AND THAT YOUR HONOR IS HOW SHE GOT INTO MY ROOM!\"",

He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket. All he needed to do was somehow get to the airport, and then he'd be home-free.  \nSo he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home. He offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc...  \nThe cabbie said, ''If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!''  \nSo the businessman was forced to hitchhike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.  \nOne year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Laughlin and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck.  \nThe businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.  \nThe businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?  \n''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.  \n''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''  \n''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.''  \nThe businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.  \nWhen he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?''  \nThe cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.''  \nThe businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went. Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each of the other drivers.",

    "selftext": "In this small town resided a church with a very large bell tower. Every morning, the bellringer walked up the tower and rang each of the towers 3 ascending bells, signaling the beginning of a new day. The town was known across the land for the beauty of the bells, and although many tried their hand at ringing the bells, no one was able to truly recreate the sound that the weathered bellringer created every morning.\n\nOne day, the bellringer passed away. The town was distraught; he had been ringing the bells every morning for decades, who would call in the day now? The head priest, after mourning, decided to put out an open invitation for anyone who wanted to be the new bellringer, with the only condition being that the priest approves of the sound that they created. People came from far and wide, all of them confident in their ability, but none succeeding. Day after day, the priest watched dozens of participants, and none of them were able to satisfy him.\n\n2 weeks into the trial, the town was greeted with heavy rain. In turn, there were no participants walking into the church. As the priest was beginning to question if a replacement would ever be found, the doors of the church creaked open, and a single man walked in. But the priest couldn't help but stare oddly, as the man in front of him had no arms.\n\nThe man walked up to the priest. \"Father, I have traveled from a far away land, and I would be honored to take the test to become the new bellringer.\" \n\nThe priest was skeptical, but as a non-judgmental man, spoke to the man,\"God accepts all participants my son. What is your name?\"\"My name is not important father, what does matter is my skill.\" the man said confidently. Skeptical, the priest took the armless man up the stairs to the first bell. The man, with a look of confidence in his eye, walked up to the bell, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and swung forward, sending his forehead crashing into the bell.\n\nThe priest's concern for the man was immediately overtaken by awe, as the pristine sound of the bell rang through the air, just as it had for so many years. Stunned, the father looked at the armless man, who stared back with a grin on his face.\n\nThe priest was pleasantly surprised, but still skeptical. He guided the man to a second set of stairs that led up to the second bell. Because of the way the building was structured, the bell was at the end of a platform in the middle of the room. The armless man walked to the end of the platform, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and once again swung his forehead into the bell, and once again the priests ears were met with a heavenly ring. The sound has caught the attention of the townsfolk, who have begun to gather around the church. As if a sign from God himself, the rain had ceased, and the sky began to clear.\n\nThe priest is ecstatic. Finally, he had found  the man he had been looking for! However, the trial was not yet finished, and so he took the armless man up the third set of stairs to the third bell. The third bell, being the smallest of the three, was placed slightly higher off the end of the platform. Still, the armless man was determined. He walked to the end of the platform, took a deep breath, leaned back.... and completely missed the bell. Losing his balance, the man fell from the platform and tumbled down all 3 floors to the bottom of the tower. The priest, stunned, began to sprint down the stairs, praying for the mans safety.\n\nBy the time the priest had reached the bottom of the tower, the townspeople had gathered around the armless man, who lay motionless in the mud. The town doctor, who had been inspecting him, stood up slowly, shaking his head. Spotting the priest, the doctor walks up to him. \"It is unfortunate, but the man has passed on. Father, do you know who this man is?\"\n\nThe priest, wiping the tears from his eyes, looked at the doctor. \"No doctor, I had just now met this man. However, his face does ring a bell\"",

After several interviews I settled on a German fellow to be in charge of operations, a Frenchman in charge of personnel and a Chinaman (get over it, in the joke its the 50’s, OK?) heads up the supply division. \n\nAfter a month I head back down there to check in and call all 3 of my lieutenants into the office.  After waiting a few minutes I ask the German and Frenchman where the Chinese guy is. They look back and forth at each other and the German sheepishly admits, “well see sir, despite me implementing strict protocol about who was allowed in what areas, he still managed to make his way down the mineshaft a few weeks ago and we haven’t seen him since.”\n\nWell this simply won’t do, so we all go down into the mine looking for him. Looking around for several hours we still can’t find him. About to give up I sit down on a rock pile. All of a sudden the chinaman pops out from behind the rocks and yells, “SUPWISE!!”\n\n(Say “supplies” but with a bad fake Chinese accent of that helps...)",

Here, have another drink, and tell me about the second-best day of your life.\"\n\n\"Second-best, huh? That might've been the day Jim Bob's prize hog broke out of its pen and got lost in the bayou. He was mighty attached to that hog, so we put together a search party and went looking. Just before sunset we found it. Then, we all fucked it. Not as great as Mrs. Jones, but pretty damn good.\"\n\n\"Damn it, man, I can't possibly print that story,\" says the reporter despairingly.

    "selftext": "Dressed to the 9s, and clearly not hurting for money. He gets out of the car and is accompanied by an ostrich and a cat. The unlikely trio go into the diner and find a place to sit. When the waitress comes to take their order, the man orders the meatloaf, the ostrich also orders the meatloaf, and the cat orders the tuna while reminding the man that he (the man) will be paying for the meal. The man agrees, and the order is put in. The waitress brings the food and asks if there’s anything else that’s needed. The man says no, so does the ostrich, and the cat once again reminds the man that he’s paying, and orders a side dish.\nAt the end of the meal, the bill is brought. The man looks at it, is reminded that the cat isn’t paying, reaches into his pocket and pulls out exact change plus the perfect tip. The waitress can’t contain her curiosity any longer and asks the man what exactly is going on.\n\n“Well,” said the man, “years ago I was walking along the beach and came across a lamp. I rubbed it and a genie popped out. He gave me 3 wishes. My first wish was that whenever I wanted to buy something, I just had to reach into my pocket and the exact amount would come out, plus appropriate tip.”\n\nThe waitress was amazed. “What about the other two wishes?”\n\nThe man gestured to his animal companions. “I wished for a chick with long legs who agreed with everything I said, and a tight pussy.”",

Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help.\n\nThere stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to  disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple  loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving  along delivering the toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions  deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.\n\nQuestion: Only one of them survived the accident. Who was the survivor?\n\nAnswer #1: A Woman’s Response: The perfect woman! She’s the only  one that really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no  Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man.\n\nAnswer #2: A Man’s Response: So, if there is no perfect man and no  Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. This explains why  there was a car accident in the first place.",

Since he had been gone so long, they decided to let a ‘fine Irish Lass’, who had been trained in recovery and scuba to go meet him and then find a place to land a helicopter.\n\nAs she walked out of the surf, she pulled off her headgear and shook out her long, golden locks.\nHe greeted her and couldn’t believe his eyes.\nShe unzipped her top about six inches, revealing her beautiful skin, pulled out a flask of Jameson’s and asked, “ how long has it been since you tasted home?”\nHe cried out, “Oh tis the nectar of the Gods” and took a big swig.\n\nShe then unzipped her top further revealing her tanned, tight cleavage, pulled out a cigar and asked, ‘and how long has it been since you’ve had a good smoke?”\nAs she lit it, he took a long pull and sighed, ‘it reminds me of an evening overlooking the moor!’\n\nAt this point she noticed his tanned, hardened body-the time on the island had been *good* to this Irishman.\nSo she unzipped her top the rest of the way, revealing her nakedness and asked, “and when was the last time you played around?’\n\nAnd he exclaimed, “Glory be to God don’t tell me you’ve got a set o’ clubs in their too!”",

When they look down, they are surprised to find they can’t see the bottom.  So they drop a couple of rocks down the hole and listen…  Nothing.  One of them says, \"Man, that’s a deep hole!\" Thinking they might hear something larger hit the bottom, they find a big, old cinder block and pitch it over the side.  The pause and listen intently…  They hear a sound, but it is coming from behind them!  They quickly turn around to see a goat bearing down on them with it head lowered, flying along, its feet barely touching the ground, its moving so fast! The two men dive out of its way just in time and the goat plunges past them, into the seemingly bottomless hole, to its doom.  The two look at each other and say, \"Boy that was close! We’d better get away from this thing before we end up with the goat!\" So they continue on their way down the road until they happen across this farmer working near it.  The men again put their heads together and figure that the goat belongs to the farmer and the decide to tell him what happened. \"Hey Mr. Farmer. Do you happen to own a goat?\" one of the men asked.  The farmer replies, \"Yeah, why do you ask?\"  The men then tell what happened at the hole and how they narrowly avoided death in the hole from the speeding goat. The farmer said, \"Well boys, I don’t think that was my goat. You see, my goat was really old and crippled up with arthritis. There is no way he could have been moving that fast. Besides, I had him tied to this big, old cinder block.\"",

Solemnly, they entered his bedchambers and approached the old man,\n\n\"Holy Father, we have found a cure for your affliction, but it comes at a great cost. We are afraid that the only way your life would be saved is for you to engage in sexual relations with a woman. Please believe us that if there was any other way to save you, it would have found it by now.\"\n\nThe dying man closed his eyes, breathed a rasping sigh, and nodded.\n\n\"I understand my friends. Our lord truly does work in mysterious ways. He has provided this miracle - it is clear that He has plans for me yet and does not wish for me to enter His kingdom at this time.\" After a long pause, he continued, \"if His will be done, and I am to lay with a woman then I have three requests.\"\n\n\"Of course - anything you wish. You have only to ask,\" came the reply with a sigh of relief.\n\n\"First,\" said the Pope, \"the woman must be blind so that she may not see with whom she lays\".\n\n\"Yes, yes, discretion must be maintained\" the cardinals responded nodding.\n\n\"Second,\" said the Pope, \"the woman must also be deaf so that she may not hear and perhaps guess as to my identity\".\n\n\"Brilliant your Holiness,\" the cardinals agreed. \"And what, Father, is your third request?\"\n\n\"Big tits\"",

So the man finishes the apple, and orders a couple more.\n\n\nA few moments later a second person walks in, looks at the guy eating the apple, then the bartender, and then back at the man, and says, \"What's with the apple\". \n\n\nThe first man still eating the apple replies, \"Order whatever you want, he'll hand you an apple that will taste like whatever you asked for\".\n\n\nThe man thinks for a moment and says, \"I'll have a rum and coke\". The bartender reaches under the counter, pulls out an apple, and replies, \"One rum and coke, enjoy\".\n\n\nThe guy takes a bite out of the apple, and like the first guy smiles, and says, \"that's the best rum I've ever had\". The bartender smiles and says, \"turn it around\". The man turns the apple around, and takes a bite and it tastes just like coke. He enjoys the rest of his apple, and orders a few more.\n\n\nA little while later, a third guy walks in, sits down at the bar, looks at the two guys eating apples and says, \"What's with the apples\". The first guy tells him, \"Ask the bartender for anything you want, and he will hand you an apple that tastes exactly like what you asked for, I asked for a gin and tonic, this guy asked for a rum and coke\".\n\n\nThe guy thinks for a minute, smiles a devilish smile, and says, \"Do you have any pussy\". The bartender rolls his eyes and says, \"Really pussy\". The guy nods his head, and the bartender reaches under the bar and hands him an apple, the bartender goes back to cleaning some glasses. The man takes a bite out of his apple, and immediately spits the bite out saying, \"Ewww, gross, this apple tastes like shit\". \n\n\nThe bartender replies, \"Turn it around\".",
